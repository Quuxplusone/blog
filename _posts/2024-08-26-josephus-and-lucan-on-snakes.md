"Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds."
[Flavius Josephus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus), in _Antiquities of the Jews_
[II.10](https://archive.org/details/genuineworksoffl01jose_0/page/167)
(circa A.D. 94), recounts one of those mighty deeds: While on the march against the Ethiopians

> [Moses] gave a wonderful demonstration of his sagacity; when the ground was
> difficult to be passed over, because of the multitude of serpents [...],
> Moses invented a wonderful stratagem to preserve the army safe, and without hurt;
> for he made baskets, like unto arks, of sedge, and filled them with [ibes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibis),
> and carried them along with them; which animal is the greatest enemy to
> serpents imaginable, for they fly from them when they come near them;
> and as they fly they are caught and devoured by them, as if it were done [by the harts](#josephus-tr.-whiston-writes-that);
> but the ibes are tame creatures, and only enemies to the serpentine kind:
> but about these ibes I say no more at present, since the Greeks themselves
> are not unacquainted with this sort of bird. As soon, therefore, as Moses
> was come to the land which was the breeder of these serpents, he let loose the ibes,
> and by their means repelled the serpentine kind, and used them for his assistants
> before the army came upon that ground. When he had therefore proceeded thus on his
> journey, he came upon the Ethiopians before they expected him; and, joining battle
> with them, he beat them, and deprived them of the hopes they had of success
> against the Egyptians, and went on in overthrowing their cities,
> and indeed made a great slaughter of these Ethiopians.

Translator [William Whiston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whiston) adds a footnote:

> Pliny speaks of these birds called _Ibes_, and says [[_Natural History_ 10.28](https://archive.org/details/plinysnaturalhi00unkngoog/page/214)],
> "The Egyptians invoked them against the serpents."

In other words: ["The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry drives the snake away."](https://quuxplusone.github.io/Advent/)
Now if only I knew a classical reason why the rod should scare the bird...

Roughly the same legend is recounted in the [Book of Jasher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_haYashar_(midrash))
[24.4–7](https://archive.org/details/jasherlostbookof0000sefe/page/169), although that telling omits
the wicker cages.

My "[...]" elides Josephus' lengthy parenthetical:

> (which it produces in vast numbers, and, indeed, is singular in some of those productions,
> which other countries do not breed, and yet such as are worse than others in power and mischief,
> and an unusual fierceness of sight, some of which ascend out of the ground unseen,
> and also fly in the air, and so come upon men at unawares, and do them a mischief)

Serendipitously, in between bookmarking that passage in Josephus for its _Adventure_ resonance
and actually getting around to blogging it, I read Canto XXIV of Dante's _Inferno_ (circa A.D. 1310, [tr. Hollander](https://amzn.to/3T1JPDG)),
in which the poet writes of [Malebolge's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malebolge) seventh ditch:

> In it I saw a dreadful swarm of serpents,  
> of so strange a kind that even now  
> when I remember them it chills my blood.  
>
> Let Libya with all her sands no longer boast,  
> for though she fosters chelydri, jaculi,  
> phareae, cenchres, and amphisbaena,  
>
> she never reared so many venomous pests,  
> nor so appalling — not with all of Ethiopia  
> and the lands that lie along the Red Sea coast.

The "Libya" here is the one depicted in gory detail by
Lucan's _Pharsalia_ (circa A.D. 65), [book IX](https://archive.org/details/L220LucanTheCivilWarPharsalia/page/n575/mode/2up)
(tr. [J. D. Duff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Duff_Duff)):

> In this land [Medusa's blood] sent up the <b>asp</b> [...]
> And there the huge <b>haemorrhois</b>, which will not suffer the blood of its victim
> to stay in the veins, opens out its scaly coils; there is the <b>chersydros</b>,
> created to inhabit the Syrtis, half land and half sea; the <b>chelydrus</b>,
> whose track smokes as it glides along; the <b>cenchris</b>, which moves ever in a
> straight line — its belly is more thickly chequered and spotted than the Theban
> serpentine with its minute patterns; the <b>ammodytes</b>, of the same colour
> as the scorched sand and indistinguishable from it; the <b>cerastes</b>,
> which wanders about as its spine makes it turn; the <b>scytale</b>, which alone
> can shed its skin while the rime is still scattered over the ground;
> the dried-up <b>dipsas</b>; the fell <b>amphisbaena</b>, that moves towards each of its two heads;
> the <b>natrix</b>, which pollutes waters, and the <b>iaculus</b>, that can fly;
> the <b>parias</b>, that is content to plough a track with its tail;
> the greedy <b>prester</b>, that opens wide its foaming mouth; the deadly <b>seps</b>,
> that destroys the bones with the body [...]

In fact Dante shows us a flying [iaculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaculus)
in _Inferno_ XXIV.97–120, piercing the body of the sinner Vanni Fucci and turning
him (temporarily) to ash — one-upping Lucan's own depiction in
[IX.822–827](https://archive.org/details/L220LucanTheCivilWarPharsalia/page/n585/mode/2up).

Josephus (tr. Whiston) writes that the snakes are devoured by the ibises "as if it were done by the harts."
I didn't understand this reference at all; but [Henry St John Thackeray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_St._John_Thackeray),
in his circa-1930 translation for the Loeb Classical Library,
[gives](https://archive.org/details/josephusjewishan0004ehwa/page/272/mode/2up) a useful footnote:

> I was tempted to read ὑπ᾽ ἐλάφ&lt;ροτέρ&gt;ων "by their nimbler adversaries"; but no emendation is needed.
> [Bochart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Bochart), _Hierozoicon_,
> [i.885 f.](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_3tKNpYajpNgC/page/n539/mode/2up) (1675),
> quotes an array of classical allusions to serpent-eating stags,
> who, according to one scholiast, derived their very name from the habit:
> εἴρηται δὲ παρὰ τὸ ἑλεῖν τὰς ὄφεις, οἱονεὶ ἑλοφίς τις ὤν!
> See [Mair's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_William_Mair) Oppian (L.C.L.),
> [ad Cyn. ii. 233](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.12696/page/76/mode/2up),
> [Hal. ii. 289](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.12696/page/308/mode/2up).

In other words (if my computer-assisted Ancient Greek is anything to go on),
the Homeric scholiast is claiming that _elaphus_ “deer”’s full name is _elein tas opheis_ "grasper of snakes."
(For more contrived etymologies, see [_Cratylus_](/blog/2021/07/15/cratylus/).)
