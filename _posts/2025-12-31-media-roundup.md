Again this year, I kept a record of the media that I took in — in the sense of
books, films, stage shows, journal articles, magazines, TV series, and
(to a much lesser extent) long-form online content.
(Last year's post is [here](/blog/2024/12/31/media-roundup/).)

## Methodology

Every time I finished a work, I wrote down the work's title, author,
year of composition (if available), and the date I finished it, along
with a one-letter annotation of its kind (`b` for book, `f` for film, etc.),
and three kinds of formalized tag: &#x2672; for things I was re-watching or re-reading;
&#x2B50; for things I decided were good enough to... well, to merit a star, I guess;
and (new this year) &#x1F5D1; to distinguish "bad, terrible, avoid"
from "decent, meh, whatever." I also tried, haphazardly, to note down (in parentheses)
when I _started_ a work, plus a &#x1F5D1; if I confidently abandoned it
as worthless.

That last notation allows me to see that I've been in the middle of
(well, near the start of) the _Morgante Maggiore_ for a whole year now.

I stuck with last year's meaningless distinction between `e`-books and
and `b`-ooks, and added `a`-udiobooks too, though the only audiobooks
I listened to (in company with my lovely wife) were Dante's _Divine Comedy_
(in Herbert Kenny's somewhat newbie-friendly but annoyingly alliterative translation,
via [Audible](https://amzn.to/4bcGwTW))
and Robert Asprin's _Another Fine Myth_ (one I enjoyed as a kid and wanted to
re-read; [Audible](https://amzn.to/4slOIaM)).

Last year I haphazardly recorded some significant long-form essays
or magazine articles under the `o` tag. This year I did the same; although now
it's abundantly clear that the `o` doesn't stand for `o`-nline so much as
l-`o`-ngform, or maybe "junk tax-`o`-n."
The five pieces I recorded this year are from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6zRMAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA359">1900</a>,
<a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/education/materials/WhyIWroteYellowWallPaper.pdf">1913</a>,
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1990/02/26/coyote-v-acme">1990</a>,
<a href="https://www.angelfire.com/art/archictecture/articles/cumae.htm">2003</a>, and
<a href="https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/lessons-of-babel/articles/translation-and-taste">2025</a>.
(Last year's spanned "merely" <a href="https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento-prod/filer_public/Images%20of%20the%20Past/TheCusterWolf/USDA-NewsRelease.pdf">1924</a>
to <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/07/cat-person-kristen-roupenian-viral-story-about-me.html">2021</a>.)

My magazine consumption has allegedly risen from 27 to 43 this year, but I suspect
that's due only to better recordkeeping. My consumption of journal articles — mostly
through JSTOR, mostly in literary criticism — is legitimately high and rising.
[Did you know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:JSTOR)
that almost all Wikipedia editors are entitled to free JSTOR access via their existing Wikipedia login?

All in all, I bothered to record my consumption of
2 <nobr>`a`-udiobooks,</nobr>
5 <nobr>l-`o`-ngform</nobr> pieces,
11 <nobr>`p`-oems,</nobr>
15 live <nobr>`s`-tage</nobr> shows and 9 <nobr>`r`-ecordings</nobr> of stage shows,
28 seasons of <nobr>`t`-elevision,</nobr>
39 dead-tree <nobr>`b`-ooks,</nobr>
43 <nobr>`m`-agazines,</nobr>
102 <nobr>`j`-ournal</nobr> articles,
152 <nobr>`e`-books,</nobr>
and 229 <nobr>`f`-ilms,</nobr> for a total of 635 items. (Wow!)

## Book clubs

Many "constellations" in my list center around works discussed in book clubs.
In 2025, book clubs in which I participated finished Dante's _Divine Comedy_;
Plutarch's _Lives_; Ovid's _Metamorphoses_; Voltaire's _Candide_;
Virgil's _Aeneid_; a selection of works by Jorge Luis Borges;
and Richard Adams' _Watership Down_.

I also attended a discussion on Walter Scott's _The Antiquary_ (1816), a book
I came not even remotely close to finishing. I can handle a three-volume
novel like [_The Mummy!_](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2024/04/08/the-mummy/)
all right, but only because it's got mummies and robots. Replace them with
impenetrably accented Scottish peasants and it becomes a slog, relieved only
inadequately by the occasional [seal-fight](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.272686/page/n305/mode/1up).

## Recommendations and breakdowns

In 2024 I recorded 12 great (&#x2B50;) movies I'd seen for the first time and 11
I'd rewatched. This year those numbers were 5 new and 25 rewatched.
I think this jibes with my expectations: Keeping the list last year
reminded me that I already _know_ a lot of good films I want to rewatch
— every year, if possible — and all I have to do is... do it.

Why such a drop in the number of stars awarded to new-to-me films?
Did I spend less time watching new movies _because_ I was revisiting
old friends? No: I recorded 229 films this year, up from 200 last year.
Were my standards higher because of re-exposure to the classics? Maybe.
I don't know.

Anyway, the new-to-me movies I really enjoyed this year
were _Passage to Marseille_ (1944), _Altered States_ (1980),
_Oscar_ (1991), _Luther_ (2003), and _Clear History_ (2013).
_Altered States_ in particular is worth going into unspoiled.

Last year I recorded 12 new &#x2B50; books and 4 re-reads.
This year those numbers were 15 new and 4 re-reads,
plus an honorable mention for Milman Parry's posthumous
[_The Making of Homeric Verse_](https://archive.org/details/MilmanParryTheMakingOfHomericVerse1971) (1971);
which at 478 pages I did not attempt to finish, but I read three or four of the essays.
In general, collections and anthologies continue to pose problems for my methodology:
I could read five of the ten essays in a collection and not record a `b` (since it was "unfinished"),
yet if I read just one of those same essays on JSTOR, I'd record it as a distinct `j`.
Nonetheless, the Edward Wagenknecht–edited [_Chaucer: Modern Essays in Criticism_](https://amzn.to/4beZr0v) (1959) makes
the list as an ensemble performance.

Another odd entry here is the last one: Henry Norman Hudson's edition of
Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_ has such insightful and entertaining footnotes that I gave
it its own entry. Hudson emphasizes the degree to which Shakespeare drew from Plutarch's
_Life of Brutus_, _Life of Caesar_, and _Life of Antony_, including extensive quotation
from Plutarch attached to specific scenes in the play. (In fact I was reading
Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_ cover-to-cover for the first time only because our Plutarch
book club this year finished our 2+-year reading of the _Lives_ and chose the play
for a digestif.)

My highest praise to Oscar Wilde's _The Decay of Lying_ (1891), which was new to me in March
of this year. I keep running into situations where it's quotable; and when I see someone else
quoting it, I smile. Samuel Butler's _Erewhon_ is also full of memorable bits, although there
is some padding between. It convinced me to buy a copy of Butler's magnum opus _The Way of All Flesh_
for my tsundoku shelf; maybe you'll see that on next year's list.

Stephen King's _The Revenge of Lard-Ass Hogan_ (1975) was new
to me last December; I re-read it in May (alongside Rob Reiner's film
[_Stand By Me_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Me_(film))) and
once again couldn't keep a straight face.
Samuel Beckett's _Waiting for Godot_ (1952) is excellent; only Jamie Lloyd's 2025 stage production
[was bad](/blog/2025/09/25/its-awful/).

The rest comprise `j`-ournal articles, `m`-agazine issues, `r`-ecorded stage shows, live `s`-tage shows, and `t`-elevision series.

As of this writing I am about three months behind on my _Atlantic_ and _New York_ subscriptions.
I forget completely how the _Atlantic_'s December 2024 and May 2025 issues earned their stars,
but I do remember thinking "This one's firing on all cylinders for once."

San Francisco's Gilbert & Sullivan troupe, the Lamplighters, published through
[their Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/lamplightersmt)
a recording of their 1995 gala performance, _Rosencrantz & Guildenstern's Excellent Adventure_.
It's "back in the vault" now, sadly — [the YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MfajzQRYJs)
is private — but it is absolutely delightful. Meanwhile, NYC's Blue Hill Troupe staged
an excellent performance of G&S's rarely-performed _Grand Duke_

In 2025 I binge-watched the entirety of HBO's _The Wire_. Highly recommended.
