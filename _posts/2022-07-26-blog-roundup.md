excerpt: |
  The other day I enjoyed reading Tanner Greer's
  ["The World that Twitter Never Made"](https://scholars-stage.org/the-world-that-twitter-never-made/) (July 2022).
  That essay is a blog-postscript to Greer's own _City Journal_ essay of the day before,
  ["Our Problems Aren't Procedural"](https://www.city-journal.org/our-problems-arent-procedural),
  which itself was a response to Jonathan Haidt's _Atlantic_ cover story
  ["After Babel"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/)
  (May 2022). Haidt had argued that the past decade of "uniquely stupid"
  American political-and-social culture can basically all be blamed on decays in

  > social capital (extensive social networks with high levels of trust),
  > strong institutions, and shared stories. Social media has weakened all three.

The other day I enjoyed reading Tanner Greer's
["The World that Twitter Never Made"](https://scholars-stage.org/the-world-that-twitter-never-made/) (July 2022).
That essay is a blog-postscript to Greer's own _City Journal_ essay of the day before,
["Our Problems Aren't Procedural"](https://www.city-journal.org/our-problems-arent-procedural),
which itself was a response to Jonathan Haidt's _Atlantic_ cover story
["After Babel"](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/)
(May 2022). Haidt had argued that the past decade of "uniquely stupid"
American political-and-social culture can basically all be blamed on decays in

> social capital (extensive social networks with high levels of trust),
> strong institutions, and shared stories. Social media has weakened all three.

(In May I found Haidt's essay enjoyable but in a guilty-pleasure way; it was
a little too obvious that Haidt was rhetorically pushing the same outrage-inducing,
_Atlantic_-reader-pleasing buttons that he claimed were the problem in the first place.)
Greer writes:

Greer's differentiation between theories of procedure and theories of substance
reminds me of a bit from Karl Popper's
[_The Logic of Scientific Discovery_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery) (1934) —
specifically [his preface](https://archive.org/details/logicofscientifi00popp/page/15/mode/1up)
to the 1958 English translation:

> Language analysts believe that there are no genuine philosophical problems,
> or that the problems of philosophy, if any, are problems of linguistic usage,
> or of the meaning of words. I, however, believe that there is at least one
> philosophical problem in which all thinking men are interested. It is the
> problem of [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_cosmology):
> the problem of understanding the world — including ourselves, and our knowledge,
> as part of the world. All science is cosmology, I believe, and for me the
> interest of philosophy as well as of science lies solely in the contributions
> which they have made to it [i.e., to cosmology]. [...]
> Admittedly, understanding the functions of language is an important part of [that goal];
> but explaining away our problems as merely linguistic "puzzles" is not.

Sections 4–6 expand on this theme. Essentially, Popper frowns on his peers' attempts
to produce a formal language that equates _meaningfulness_ with _verifiability_ —
that is, to produce a "language of science" in which only empirical and scientific
statements are considered meaningful, and metaphysical claims are considered
not just undecidable but fundamentally meaningless.
[Footnote, page 40](https://archive.org/details/logicofscientifi00popp/page/40/mode/1up):

> Note that I suggest [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability)
> as a criterion of [demarcation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem)
> [between scientific hypotheses and metaphysical claims],
> but <b>not of meaning</b>. [...] Falsifiability separates two kinds of perfectly
> meaningful statements: the falsifiable and the non-falsifiable. It draws a line
> inside meaningful language, not around it.

Popper's theory of science requires (rather than forbids)
that it be possible to utter non-empirical and metaphysical ideas — not as
nonsense strings, but as _ideas_.

By the way, the middle section of the book is taken up by a very long and
boring digression into Popper's own idiosyncratic version of probability theory.
On page 159 Popper (writing in 1958) footnotes:

> I suggest that sections 55 to 64, or perhaps only 56 to 64, be skipped
> at first reading. It may even be advisable to turn from here [page 159],
> or from the end of section 55, direct to chapter X [page 251].

[And I am two-and-twenty, and oh, ’tis true, ’tis true.](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52706/when-i-was-one-and-twenty-56d2316642304)

Finally, I highly recommend ["The Grug Brained Developer."](https://grugbrain.dev/)
This is a great, great bit of tech writing — curmudgeonly, witty, and above all,
pleasantly insightful. The writing voice is that of a caveman developer named Grug —
voice-wise somewhere between [Gronk from _Lost Pig_](https://pr-if.org/play/lostpig/)
and [Eloise from the Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eloise_(1955_book)).

Grug, like Arthur, is a big fan of Chesterton's Fence.
