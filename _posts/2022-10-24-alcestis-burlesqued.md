Previously on this blog: ["Sonia Greene's _Alcestis_"](/blog/2022/10/22/alcestis/) (2022-10-22),
["Notes on Sonia Greene's _Alcestis_"](/blog/2022/10/23/notes-on-alcestis/) (2022-10-23).

After finishing Greene's and Kynaston's <i>Alcestis</i>&#x200A;es (_Alcesteis_?),
I next tackled [_Alcestis Burlesqued_](https://books.google.com/books?id=_PheAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP1) (1816),
by one Issachar Styrke. It starts strong, in the mold of Roald Dahl's
[_Revolting Rhymes_](https://amzn.to/3glqCwc); I laughed out loud at
Apollo's prologue:

> [Jove, one day, by] malice led,  
> Made bold to knock my son o' th' head  
> With a stout broom-stick. I, on fire,  
> And glowing quite red-hot with ire,  
> Whipp'd it, quick as some men fly,  
> To th' broom-stick manufactory...

For a relentlessly jocular yet _one hundred percent shot-for-shot faithful_
interpretation of Euripides, it's really impressive — not to mention that the
jokes make it twice as long as the original. But I did feel that the
writer started flagging by the end.

Both Styrke's (1816) and [Kynaston's](https://books.google.com/books?id=jZINAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1) (1906)
translations vary the meter: the Chorus's strophes and antistrophes use
generally shorter lines than the big speeches. Some of these meters
remind me irresistibly of W.S. Gilbert's (unsurprisingly, given that
they're all products of a classical British education).
For example, here's the Chorus's strophe circa
[lines 903–910](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0087%3Acard%3D903):

> ἐμοί τις ἦν ἐν γένει,  
> &nbsp; ᾧ κόρος ἀξιόθρηνος  
> ὤλετ᾽ ἐν δόμοισιν  
> μονόπαις: ἀλλ᾽ ἔμπας  
> ἔφερε κακὸν ἅλις, ἄeτεκνος ὤν,  
> πολιὰς ἐπὶ χαίτας  
> ἤδη προπετὴς ὢν  
> βιότου τε πόρσω.

I dare you to read Kynaston's translation without
thinking of peppery potentate King Hildebrand:

> Of a kinsman I could tell  
> Whom a grievous loss befell  
> &nbsp; Of an only son;  
> Yet he bore his childless state  
> With affliction moderate  
> &nbsp; In the latter stage  
> &nbsp; Of a hoary age  
> When his course was well-nigh run.

Or Styrke's without thinking of the Duke of Plaza Toro
or King Paramount:

> Some ten years back, or thereabout,  
> &nbsp; I had a near relation  
> With whom I've often supp'd sour-crout  
> &nbsp; Till in a perspiration.  
> As Fortune will'd, he had one brat,—  
> &nbsp; No rickets had he on him,  
> Nor huckle-back'd,— but spite of that,  
> &nbsp; Old Death laid hands upon him.  
> Poor coz! it grieved him sore so soon  
> &nbsp; To be bilk'd of his chicken;  
> But still he had sense not to swoon  
> &nbsp; Although with age hard stricken.  
> Full fourscore years of solid time  
> &nbsp; In telling he'd succeeded;  
> Then why should you, who're in your prime,  
> &nbsp; Bear these ills worse than he did?  
> [...]  
> But why give loose to tears and sobs,  
> &nbsp; And look so monstrous paley?  
> Such awkward, dolorific jobs  
> &nbsp; Are happ'ning almost daily.

("They happen almost every day in England!")
