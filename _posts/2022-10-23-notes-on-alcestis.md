Previously on this blog: ["Sonia Greene's _Alcestis_"](/blog/2022/10/22/alcestis/) (2022-10-22).
Here are some notes on that text from the copy-editor (that is, me).

Again, for Euripides' original play, see
[Richard Aldington's](http://classics.mit.edu/Euripides/alcestis.pl.txt)
or [Herbert Kynaston's](https://books.google.com/books?id=jZINAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1)
translations. Kynaston's endnotes are particularly useful.

----

The first thing you'll notice is that the whole Prologue is in blank verse,
and then the Play itself is in prose, except for the heroic
couplets extolling Heracles that close the first and last scenes.
(Other heroic couplets appear in Prologue scenes 3 and 5.)

There is one place in the Prologue where the iambic pentameter
breaks down in an interesting way: the opening of scene 6,
where Apollo bursts in on the Fates with "signs of haste."

> Stay, potent sisters, for I see whose thread  
> You, Atropos, have poised on your shears.  
> It is for him that I have come to plead —  
> Admetus, Phaere's King and noblest friend.

You'd naturally expect the line to read "You, Atropos, have poised
_upon_ your shears." (I assume that "poised" is to be read as "pois'd,"
not "poiséd." In this scene we also find "watched," "flowed," and
"conquered" with the modern number of syllables, although in Act III
we find an explicit "conquer'd.")

Indeed, this might just be a typo in the text,
and at first I was tempted to correct it. But read it again — that
little hiccup or gasp in the second line could be just the right
indication of how hurried and out of breath Apollo is. This is the
one place where, lyrically speaking, his godly poise breaks down
and he does _not_ speak in stately measured tones.

There are a few other places where the meter fails in less interesting
ways. For example, I cannot make "Pluto at all times
has his brother's ear" scan no matter how I read it.
Subsequent revisions would probably have introduced Pluto on the previous
line; say, "The nether god has influence above / At all times he has
his brother's ear."

In Zeus's last speech in Prologue scene 2, the typescript had
"Though daily clamoured and complained"; I assumed the word
"Pluto" was missing, and inserted it.

----

Admetus' "Lybian flute" resembled a typo for "Lydian," but what
Euripides [wrote](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0087%3Acard%3D328)
is Λίβυν "Libyan," and so I left the word alone as either an
intentional archaism or an accidental misspelling. (I think the
latter, since Greene earlier misspells "Hippolytus" as "Hyppolitus.")

----

The first scene of the Prologue visits some Lovecraftian horror
tropes (cyclopean masonry, horned moons, vague wings), but after
that scene everything gets much less Lovecraftian and much more
classical.

----

Reading [Herbert Kynaston's translation of Euripides](https://books.google.com/books?id=jZINAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1)
reminded me that Greek tragedy hewed to the [Three Unities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_unities).
Euripides doesn't _show_ us Alcestis placing wreaths on the altars of her bedchamber,
but merely describes it (because the action uniformly takes place in the courtyard of
Admetus' palace). In fact in Euripides we get the whole action of the Prologue "told, not shown"
as well, from Apollo's lips; it's only because Greene is a modern writer willing to dispense
with unity of time, place, and action that her Prologue is able to _show_ us occurrences that happened
months earlier, in different cities, involving different characters.

However, Greene still doesn't depart from Euripides far enough to _show_ us Heracles'
fight with Death; that action still takes place offstage, and feels much less satisfactory
here. The Prologue has already taken us into the Cyclopes' workshop, why shouldn't we see
Hades as well?

----

Heracles' songs are not original to Greene; they are, as advertised,
Anacreon's ode XXI translated by [Thomas Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Moore)
(["Observe, when Mother Earth is dry"](https://books.google.com/books?id=hSokAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247))
and the lyrics of the circa-1770 ["Anacreontic Song"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anacreontic_Song)
("To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee"). It's also
interesting to me that the stage directions are so peppered with
suggestions for incidental music, in some cases
(e.g. Saint-Saens' _Danse Macabre_)
apparently chosen for allusive effect rather than mood, as if the
play were a Looney Tunes short. Then again, it _is_ a comedy.

----

The resentful old servant that Greene names "Phlegon" is unnamed in Euripides.
But "Phlegon" is a perfectly cromulent Greek name; in Roman times
[Phlegon of Tralles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegon_of_Tralles)
compiled a list of Italian centenarians
([_Macrobii_, or _περί Μακρόβιων_](https://archive.org/details/rerumnaturaliums01kell/page/84/mode/2up)),
making that an eminently suitable name for an old man.

----

I find Euripides' dialogue between Admetus and Heracles (II.1) less clever than Greene's;
he makes Heracles already aware of Alcestis' bargain, and has Admetus _outright deny_
that Alcestis is the dead woman. In Greene's version, Admetus diplomatically describes
the dead woman as "a stranger by blood, yet near in friendship," which I think is a
great way of finessing that scene without causing the audience to lose sympathy for
Admetus.

I was surprised how closely parallel are both versions' dialogues between Admetus and Pheres
(II.2), even down to the sarcasm of "sagely hast thou devised to live for ever..."

----

Act III is rather torturous, with Heracles and Admetus going through
all sorts of unnecessary back-and-forth before finally revealing that
Heracles has rescued Alcestis. Why doesn't Heracles just come right
out and say it from the get-go? Well, at least we should remember
that the detailed plot of the play (including this part) is all
from Euripides.

Additionally, consider that Greene might have gotten herself into
this pickle via the previous note: in Euripides, Admetus flat-out _lies_
to Heracles, and perhaps Heracles is just serving Admetus some of his
own medicine. (I still think that's quite a stretch, mind you.)
In Greene, Admetus never lies, and so Heracles' deception can't be
justified even on those stretchy grounds.

This sort of torturous revelation scene for
some reason seems to be a common trope in high drama, especially in
["problem plays"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_play)
that straddle genres.
Kynaston compares Act III to the final scene of Shakespeare's
[_The Winter's Tale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter%27s_Tale).
I'd compare it to the final scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's
_Yeomen of the Guard_ (Isaac Asimov
[writes](https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/page/757/mode/1up):
"Why Fairfax does this passes human understanding. If Gilbert merely
intends an additional dramatic high note for the end, does he realize
what he is making Fairfax do? Fairfax is tormenting Elsie for no
reason at all..."), coincidentally also the most tragic
(and thus most "problem"-atic) in the G&S canon.
Or the final scene of _Iolanthe_
(which I'll crown as the most Lovecraftian play in the G&S canon,
_Ruddigore_ be darned), also featuring a veiled spouse and tragic tone;
though in _Iolanthe_'s case the subterfuge is justified, plot-wise.

----

Perhaps interestingly, Greene changes the "moral" of the story: Euripides' final chorus
unambiguously exalts Fortune and the gods:

> The countless chances of our fate  
> Oft unforeseen results await;

but in Greene's play, Admetus credits "you, and <i>only</i> you" (underline
in original), "great Heracles," with orchestrating the happy ending, tying
it more to Heracles' hero-cult.
