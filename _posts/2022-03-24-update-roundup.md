The other week, I attended a book club on Kafka's short story
[_The Burrow_](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/1/2391/files/2018/12/Kafka-The-Burrow-1jcjgv3.pdf).
It's a quite frankly brilliant portrayal of neuroticism. The titular burrow
reads like a metaphor for so many things at once: a house, a body of work,
a life history. The story (translated by [Willa and Edwin Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willa_Muir))
is quotable and yet, somehow, no pull quote could be satisfactory;
all I can recommend is that you go read it!

If you've read the traditional Kafka repertoire (_The Metamorphosis_, _The Trial_,
_Before the Law_, and so on), you might like to know that Kafka himself once boiled down
that entire genre into [seven sentences](https://www.flashfictiononline.com/article/give-it-up/):

> It was very early in the morning, the streets clean and deserted.
> I was walking to the station. As I compared the tower clock with my
> watch I realized that it was already much later than I had thought,
> I had to hurry, the shock of this discovery made me unsure of the way,
> I did not yet know my way very well in this town. Luckily, a policeman
> was nearby; I ran up to him and breathlessly asked him the way.
> He smiled and said: “From me you want to know the way?”
>
> “Yes,” I said, “since I cannot find it myself.”
>
> “Give it up! Give it up,” he said, and turned away with a sudden jerk,
> like people who want to be alone with their laughter.

This past Monday I attended [Des MacHale's _CoM_ talk on mathematical jokes and riddles](https://www.gathering4gardner.org/com-2022-3-21/).
He recited dozens of his favorites. Some were classics I'd heard before (What's purple and
commutes? An Abelian grape); some were new to me. Apropos of
[the famous story about Hardy and Ramanujan](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2022/01/30/hardy-ramanujan-and-taxi-no-1729/):

> “What was your taxicab number?”  
> “Oh, some uninteresting number... fourteen, I think.”  
> “What do you mean ‘uninteresting’? It’s the smallest number that’s the product of 2 and 7 in two different ways.”

I suppose that joke is only one lot over from the ground trodden by Douglas Hofstadter's
fictional mathematiciant [Di of Antus](https://amzn.to/3uc37cp), who wrote:

> The equation $$n^a + n^b = n^c$$
> has solutions in positive integers $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$, and $$n$$ only when $$n = 2$$
> (and then there are infinitely many triplets $$a$$, $$b$$, $$c$$ which satisfy the
> equation); but there are no solutions for $$n > 2$$. I have discovered a truly
> marvelous proof of this statement, which, unfortunately, is so small that
> it would be well-nigh invisible if written in the margin.

And a mathematical riddle: In this sequence of numbers, which one doesn't belong?

$$
    11, 13, 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, 32
$$

The answer, of course, is 24; all the others come with fried rice.

In last month's _CoM_ talk, [Jessica Sklar](https://www.gathering4gardner.org/com-2022-2-21/)
was talking about dissections of the
equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles, and I ended up googling
dissections of the equilateral triangle into other things.
According to ["A note on perfect dissections of an equilateral triangle"](https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/44/ajc_v44_p087.pdf)
(Andrzej Żak, 2009), it turns out that there's exactly(?) one way to
dissect an equilateral triangle into seven similar scalene triangles.
The diagram in Żak's paper didn't quite satisfy me, and I didn't have construction
paper handy, so I took a few hours and ordered some custom-cut aluminum triangles
from [Ponoko.com](https://www.ponoko.com/) to play around with.

I have only good things to say about Ponoko. You upload an image (such as
[this SVG image of seven similar triangles](/blog/images/2022-03-24-triangles.svg)),
choose the material and tell them how big you want it (make sure the smallest
dimension of each piece is at least one inch if you want them to deburr it for you),
and they do the rest! Totally worth it.

Interestingly, although you can dissect an equilateral triangle into (no fewer than)
seven _similar_ triangles, simultaneously you cannot dissect _any_ triangle
into seven _congruent_ triangular tiles!
See ["No triangle can be cut into seven congruent triangles"](http://www.michaelbeeson.com/research/papers/NoSevenTiling.pdf)
(Michael Beeson, 2010).
