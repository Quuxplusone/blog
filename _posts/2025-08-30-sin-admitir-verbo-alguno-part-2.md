Clara Díaz Sánchez explains that in the late 16th and early 17th century, there was in fact a
fad for poetry in which many lines ended in dactyls.

We can taxonomize lines of poetry by where their last stress falls: it could fall on the
last syllable of the line (_verso [agudo](https://dle.rae.es/agudo)_, or oxytone),
on the penultimate (_verso [llano](https://dle.rae.es/llano)_, or paroxytone),
or on the antepenultimate (_verso esdrújulo_, or proparoxytone).

Note that when we call a word "an _esdrújulo_" we mean only that it _ends_ in a dactyl, being suitable
to end a proparoxytone line. The three-syllable word _árboles_ is both an esdrújulo and a dactyl in the
English sense, whereas the four-syllable word _altíssima_ is an esdrújulo but not what I would call a dactyl.
(I mean, it _ends_ in a dactyl; but it has an extra syllable on the front.)

John T. Reid's ["Notes on the history of the verso esdrújulo"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/470076) (_Hispanic Review_ <b>7</b>:4, 1939)
is a fantastic overview of the topic. Reid gives several examples, and footnotes pointing to many more.
(Most notably he points to a hundred pages of "curious notes" in Elías Zerolo's
[_Legajo de varios_](https://archive.org/details/legajodevarios00zerouoft/page/12/mode/2up) (1897)
which I have thus far been too lazy to read.)

Esdrújulo line-endings rarely occur in typical Spanish poetry, not least because esdrújulos
are rare in Spanish to begin with. But dactyls are common in _Latin_ poetry (for example, in
Virgil's hexameter), so during the Renaissance they started appearing in learned Italian poetry
imitating the Latin idiom, and then in learned Spanish poetry imitating the Italian fad. _Verso esdrújulo_
became the mark of the erudite and faddish Spanish poet who "praises in enthusiastic tone / All
centuries but this and every country but his own." Take (please!) the _esdrujulista_ subject of
Zerolo's notes,

> [...] Bartolomé Cairasco de Figueroa, a poet from the Canary Islands who was considered the inventor of the _verso esdrújulo_.
> It will not be necessary here to review this second-rate author's appalling production,

but I'll give a sample. In his _Templo Militante_ (1618), Cairasco de Figueroa wrote a hagiography of Pope Damasus I
that reads, [in part](https://books.google.com/books?id=WDBSAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA220),
as follows. I'm certainly no expert in 17th-century Spanish tastes, but by modern standards I'm
going to call this bad poetry! The occasional short ("quebrado") lines, frequent exact rhymes
(_benemérito / mérito_, _lícito / solícito_), and flurry of line-initial "And"s give it much the same flavor as
William McGonagall's ["The Tay Bridge Disaster"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tay_Bridge_Disaster) (1880).

_Verso esdrújulo_ was the target of burlesques, such as Agustín de Salazar y Torres'
["Baile de los muchachos de la escuela"](https://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000224758&page=28) (c. 1680),
which Reid quotes:

<table class="smaller">
<tr><td>
—Bien venido, amigo Alónsigo.<br>
—Señor Beltrán, bien llegádigo.<br>
¿Cómo, amigo, hacia la escuéliga,<br>
has venido tan tempránigo?
</td><td>
—Welcome, Alonso my frienigand.<br>
—Señor Beltrán, good morniging.<br>
How is it, friend, you’ve comigome<br>
so early this morning to schooligool?
</td></tr>
</table>

The joke here is that the words are just normal Spanish (_Alonso, llegado, escuela, temprano_)
gussied up with an extra nonsense syllable so as to resemble erudite esdrújulos.

Now, as to the types of words you'd tend to find in a _verso esdrújulo_, Reid writes:

> The question of rime has caused the _esdrujulistas_ some difficulty.
> [Montemayor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_de_Montemor) early attempts had
> followed the Italian custom and the line of least resistance by confining his rimes
> almost exclusively to <b>gerunds with enclitic pronouns, superlatives, and past tenses of verbs.</b>&#8288;<sup>[1]</sup>
> The task of finding rimes was thus made comparatively easy.
> But the repetition of such forms, as Rengifo <nobr>remarked,<sup>[2]</sup></nobr> was tiresome.
> Moreover, they were too obvious for an _esdrujulista_ who prided himself on his art.
> Cervantes, in _El casamiento engañoso_, tells of a harebrained poet who composes an epic
> "todo en verso heroico, parte en octavas y parte en verso suelto; pero todo esdruxulamente,
> digo en esdruxulos de nombres sustantivos, sin admitir verbo <nobr>alguno."<sup>[3]</sup></nobr>

[1] — Montemayor's [_Diana_](https://archive.org/details/origenesdelanov01martgoog/page/258) (1559)
contains tercets like these: the first using gerund verbs with enclitic pronouns (_mirándote_ "regarding you"),
the second using infinitive verbs with enclitic pronouns (_acercárseme_ "be approaching me"), and the third
using past-imperfect-tense verbs (_apercebíamos_ "we would prepare"). I'm not 100% sure what Reid (1939)
meant by "past tenses of verbs," but my guess is that he meant things like _apercebíamos_.

[2] — Juan Díaz Rengifo in [_Arte poetica española_](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_bIfNRrQv6gMC/page/n316) (1606)
classifies esdrújulos into "verbs," "superlatives," and "substantives" (into which category he lumps both nouns,
such as _árboles, céspedes_, and adjectives, such as _estética, política_).

> **Consonante esdrúxulo** es un vocablo que tiene semejanza a otro desde la vocal antepenultima
> en que se pone el acento hasta la ultima letra; como _poético, prophético_. Hay tres maneras
> de Esdrúxulos: unos son **Verbales**, otros **Superlativos**, otros **Sustantivos y Adjetivos**.
>
> El Esdrúxulo Verbal se hace cuando a alguna persona del verbo se le añade una destas particulas
> _me, te, se, le, lo, los, vos, os, &c._ y queda con el acento en la antepenultima, como
> _matárate, dijístelo_. [...]
>
> Finalmente en las personas de los verbos que tienen el acento en la ultima, se pueden fundar
> Esdrújulos añadiendoles dos particulas, como _matómele, perdítele, hurtómelos, perdítelos, &c._ [...]
>
> Todos los nombres Superlativos acabados en _issimo_ son Consonantes entre si, como
> _sapientissimo, amantissimo_; de estos hay innumerables, y **aunque enfadarían,
> y harían la copla muy afectada si usase uno siempre dellos**, pero engeridos
> de cuando en cuando entre los demas tienen particular gracia.

[3] — So Cervantes' "harebrained poet" isn't actually talking about a poem consisting _entirely_ of dactyls
nor _entirely_ of nouns; instead he's talking about an ordinary _verso esdrújulo_ using ordinary vocabulary
within the line, but where each line _ends_ with an esdrújulo and where none of the esdrújulo words "cheat,"
Montemayor-style, by extending Spanish verbs with enclitic pronouns. He forbids himself to use rhymes like
_quejándote, alargárseme, volvíamos_. Each rhyme must be one of the less flexible "substantives" — a noun
or perhaps an adjective, never a verb (and presumably never a "cheating" superlative like _altíssima_, either).

So that's not nearly as constrained as I'd pictured in my head — my reference point of Borges' Tlönian
language was way off base.

Reid (1939) concludes:

> From its serious and possibly religious origins in Spanish verse [the _verso esdrújulo_] had become
> by the end of the nineteenth century a poetaster's folly at the worst, or a light and festive medium
> at the best. [...] The two moments in Spanish literary history when the _verso esdrújulo_ was accepted
> solemnly — the Renaissance and the Romantic period — were ages when foreign influence had made pedantic
> affectation more or less the mode. But in each case the mode was conquered, or at least assimilated,
> by earthy, satirical laughter.

Bear in mind that Cervantes was absolutely "inside baseball" on this stuff — so he was satirizing something
_he_ considered ridiculous, regardless of how it might have been viewed by the public or by the poets who wrote
it. If I understand correctly, the joke is that the poet's self-imposed task is what we'd call "putting lipstick
on a pig" or "polishing a turd."  A very rough analogy might be how a lot of limericks start with "There once was a..."
So our poet boasts that he is retelling the Matter of Britain as a series of limericks, without ever using
that hackneyed phrase. Adding constraints doesn't change the fact that you're writing a faintly ridiculous
genre of poetry to begin with. At the end of the day, it's still limericks.

This series continues with ["A poem all in dactylic noun substantives, part 3,"](/blog/2025/09/06/sin-admitir-verbo-alguno-part-3/)
in which I display a chivalric romance composed _strictly_ of dactylic nouns.
