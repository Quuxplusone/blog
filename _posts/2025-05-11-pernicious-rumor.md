In Book 4 of Virgil's _Aeneid_, I find two noteworthy phrases.
First, in [Virgil's description](https://archive.org/details/virgilwithenglis01virg/page/408)
of the monstrous goddess Rumor (lines 173–183; tr. Goold) —

> At once Rumor runs through Libya's great cities — Rumor, the swiftest
> of all evils. Speed lends her strength, and she wins vigour as she goes;
> small at first through fear, soon she mounts up to heaven and walks
> the ground with head hidden in the clouds.
>
> Mother Earth, provoked to anger against the gods, brought her forth
> last, they say, as sister to Coeus and Enceladus, swift of foot and
> fleet of wing, a monster awful and huge, who for the many feathers
> in her body has as many watchful eyes beneath — mirabile dictu — as many
> tongues, as many sounding mouths, as many pricked-up ears.

Here "swift of foot and fleet of wing" translates _pedibus celerem et pernicibus alis_,
where _pernicibus_ is a form of the Latin adjective
[_pernix_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pernix#Latin) "nimble."
I said to myself, "I've often heard of a _pernicious_ rumor, but I always
thought the word had more to do with its nipping viciousness than its mere speed!"

Well, it turns out that Latin _pernix_ is indeed only a false cognate
to English _pernicious_. The English word
[derives](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pernicious)
(via Latin [_pernicies_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pernicies))
from _per-_ "thoroughly" (as in [_perchlorate_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion#Naming),
an ion in which the central chlorine atom is even more thoroughly oxidized than in ordinary chlorate) + _necō_ "kill"
(as in [_Homo Necans_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Necans)): Something _pernicious_
thoroughly kills or destroys. But I wonder if Virgil had both words (_pernix_ and _pernicies_)
in mind when composing this line.

The critics are more than willing to credit Virgil with virtuosic double-meanings
in other places. For example, Clifford Weber, ["Some Double Entendres in Ovid and Vergil"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/270144)
(_Classical Philology_ <b>85</b>.3, July 1990), points to _Aeneid_ IV.80–83:

> Then when all have gone their ways, and in turn the dim moon sinks her light and the
> falling stars invite sleep, alone she mourns in the empty hall and falls on the couch
> he has left.

In Latin this is:

> Post ubi digressi, lumenque obscura vicissim  
> <b>luna</b> premit suadentque cadentia sidera somnos,  
> <b>sola</b> domo maeret vacua stratisque relictis  
> incubat.

Weber writes: "The sun and moon are particularly relevant to the Vergilian drama of Dido and Aeneas,
in which the Phoenician queen is associated with the moon, the Trojan king with the sun [...]
Thus, at the beginning of line 82, Vergil predisposes his reader to assume momentarily that _sol-_
belongs to a form of _sol_. [But in fact here it's a form of _solus_ ‘solitary.’]
As Dido ‘grieves alone [_sole_] in the empty house [_domo vacua_],’ the meaning with _sole_ still hovers
in the background: ‘in the sunless house she grieves.’ The ‘sunless house’ par excellence
is, of course, the underworld," where Dido arrives at the end of Book 4.

Incidentally, while Virgil describes Rumor herself in _Aeneid_ 4, Ovid very poetically describes
Rumor's _house_ in [_Metamorphoses_ 12](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph12.php#anchor_Toc64105762),
right before the "little Iliad" which precedes his "little Aeneid." (This is just one small instance of
Ovid's program of alluding to Virgil while not trying to compete with him head-to-head on any specific episode.)
The house of Rumor, says Ovid, is set at the confluence of sea, land, and sky, atop a high mountain.
It has a thousand entrances, but no doors; and it is all of sounding brass. Crowds fill the halls, murmuring,
each adding to the tale he carries. In this way Rumor herself sees everything that happens in the heavens,
in the ocean, and on land; and she inquires about everything too.

In line 81, quoted above, we hear that _suadent cadentia sidera somnos,_ "the descending stars counsel sleep."
This phrase is euphonious: Ingo Gildenhard [writes](https://books.openedition.org/obp/1934#para-171),
"In the speedy opening part, the vowel piano in _cadentia sidera_ (a-e-i-a-[i]-e-a) reflects the quickly falling
stars and acts as foil to the heavy 'os' in _somnos_," citing also [R. G. Austin](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1715353)
([1963](https://archive.org/details/austin-vergili-maronis-aeneidos-liber-quartus/page/47)):
"Note the varied vowels, the repeated _s_ sounds, the gentle assonance of _suadentque cadentia_ [...]
The rhythm itself suggests sleep." In fact the phrase is so appealing that this is the second time
Virgil has used it: the first time was at II.9.

> [...] Et iam nox umida caelo  
> praecipitat suadentque cadentia sidera somnos.

("And now dewy night is speeding from the sky and the falling stars counsel sleep.")

This phrase is puzzling at first glance: Surely the night stars are always up there — they don’t "set" like the sun!
That is, _individual_ stars and constellations may disappear below the horizon, but other stars rise to replace
them. The only way we experience a sky without stars is if it's overcast, or if the stars have been
washed out by the rising sun.

Some translators and critics take the latter way out, translating _cadentia_ as "fading" or "receding."
J. W. Mackail, in ["Notes on _Aeneid_ VIII"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/699724)
(_The Classical Review_ <b>32</b>.5/6, September 1918), writes:

> Much confusion would have been saved, here and elsewhere, by realising that _surgere_
> and _cadere_ as used of the stars by Virgil have not only their astronomical meaning
> of rising and setting, but that of appearance and disappearance with the end and
> beginning of daylight. _Cadere_ may in such passages be translated "to pale,"
> and _surgere_ "to shine out." Thus the _cadentia sidera_ of _Aen._ II.9 and
> IV.81 are the paling stars. [...] Compare [Milton's](https://archive.org/details/comus01miltgoog/page/n69)
>
> The stars grow high,  
> But night sits monarch yet in the mid sky;  
>
> where there is a different image for the same phenomenon, the fading or paling
> of the stars before dawn being pictured — which is what in fact it looks like —
> as their retreat to a greater distance.

I can't speak for Milton, but it's pretty clear that Virgil isn't talking about the
stars fading at sunrise. Sunrise is the time to _wake_, not the time to _sleep!_
George Gifford's ["A Note on Dante and Virgil"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/477488) (_Italica_ <b>35</b>.2, June 1958)
persuasively gives the correct interpretation:

> In _Inferno_ VII.98–99, [Dante's guide] Virgil urges against delay [using] a similar formula:
>
> Già ogni stella cade che saliva / Quando mi mossi,  
> [“Already sinks each star that was ascending / When I set out”]
>
> where the meaning clearly is, "six hours or more of our journey
> have elapsed; it is now past midnight." We may infer, therefore,
> that Dante took Aeneas to mean "it is past midnight." In this
> view, the "stars" referred to are <b>the constellations associated with the present season</b>,
> because they are visible in the earlier hours of
> darkness, which are normally waking hours. After midnight all of
> such stars as are visible will be setting in the west, or will at least
> have passed the zenith. They are in this sense _cadentia sidera_,
> wheeling downward in the sky.

Note that the "constellations associated with the present season" are those _opposite_ what we
think of as your "star sign." If you're born in May you're "a Taurus," but that's because the
sun is _in_ Taurus, which means Taurus is invisible — it's the constellations roughly opposite
Taurus that are considered "spring constellations" in the stargazing sense. Ursa Major, for example,
peaks in the sky around 10pm tonight, and Virgo around 11pm. (All seasons and times
Northern Hemisphere–specific.) So when Virgo and Ursa Major are "falling," says Virgil,
it's the right time for sleep.
