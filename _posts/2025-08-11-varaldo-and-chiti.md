  I serendipitously happened across a reference in Douglas Hofstadter's _Le ton beau de Marot_
  ([page 125](https://archive.org/details/letonbeaudemarot00hofs/page/125))
  to a book of poetry by Giuseppe Varaldo titled _All'alba Shahrazad andrà ammazzata_
  ("Shahrazad Shall Hang at Dawn"). Hofstadter writes:
  "In his astonishing _tour de force_ of a book, Varaldo takes roughly fifty
  classics of Western literature and synopsizes each one in a perfectly constructed
  classical Italian-style sonnet, in which _just one vowel_ appears."

## Varaldo's _All'alba Shahrazad andrà ammazzata_ (1993)

Around New Year's, while our book club was reading Dante's _Divine Comedy_,
I serendipitously happened across a reference in Douglas Hofstadter's _Le ton beau de Marot_
([page 125](https://archive.org/details/letonbeaudemarot00hofs/page/125))
to a book of poetry by Giuseppe Varaldo titled _All'alba Shahrazad andrà ammazzata_
("Shahrazad Shall Hang at Dawn"). Hofstadter writes:
"In his astonishing _tour de force_ of a book, Varaldo takes roughly fifty
classics of Western literature and synopsizes each one in a perfectly constructed
classical Italian-style sonnet, in which _just one vowel_ appears." For
example, here is Varaldo's version of Dante's _Inferno_:

> Nel mentre ch'è trentenne, l'Eccellente  
> (nelle Lettere regge, è legge, splende)  
> ben nel ventre terrestre se ne scende:  
> ente perenne, sede del Fetente.
>
> C'è gente greve, erede del Serpente,  
> che freme e geme per veneree mende,  
> che fece pecche becere e tremende,  
> che perse fede e speme e se ne pente.
>
> Cenere, selve, belve, pece, sete,  
> e febbre, vespe, neve...: pene eterne,  
> e tenebre per sempre, se entrerete!  
> Emerger preme nelle brezze verne,  
> tender testé ver belle estreme mete,  
> nell'ètere veder le stelle esterne.

For Hofstadter's virtuosically playful English gloss of this sonnet, beginning
"At a thirtysomething age, the Great Fêted One,"
see [page 126](https://archive.org/details/letonbeaudemarot00hofs/page/126).
However, Hofstadter's version, in preserving the line-by-line meaning, lost
the monovocality of the original. At some point after that, Brian Raiter took
up the challenge and composed the following virtuosically monovocalic English
_Inferno_, along with
[some quite interesting notes on its design process](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/txt/infirni-notes.html):

> Virgil finds Pilgrim drifting in midnight,  
> Bids Pilgrim visit sin's finishing pit:  
> Insists glimpsing spirits sinking in shit,  
> Sizzling in pitch, will gift him with insight.
>
> Circling in with diminishing windings,  
> Visiting kith, slinging witticisms,  
> Indicting kings with biting criticisms,  
> Inscribing in ringing tristichs his findings.
>
> Drinking in sights, drinking his fill,  
> Skirting grim imps with childish tricks,  
> Sighing, “ ’Tis right: it is His will.”  
> Pilgrim clings tight whilst Virgil climbs Nick's  
> bristling thigh: flipping, climbs still,  
> Till sighting night's shining, inspiring pinpricks.

(This is also a good place to mention that within the present decade (the 2020s),
"Kinton Ford" (a pseudonym) composed a lipogrammatic English translation of all 136 lines
of Dante's first canto, _in full terza rima_, without using the letter "e". Ford's canto
was as recently as 2025-01-02 available online [here](https://www.exquisitepandemicarchives.com/copy-of-kinton-ford),
but that's a 404 page now and it's not even in the Wayback Machine. Luckily I saved a copy
back in January; I may post it here later.)

Luckily, Hofstadter's _Le ton beau de Marot_ (1997) is easy either to
[buy](https://amzn.to/45IAyqJ) or to read online.
Varaldo's _All'alba Shahrazad andrà ammazzata_ (1993), on the other hand, is tragically
difficult. I have not yet managed to find a copy. The title poem, at least, is reproduced
[here](https://archive.org/details/la-fortuna-delle-mille-e-una-notte-nella-letteratura-italiana/page/209):

> All'alba Shahrazad andrà ammazzata.  
> Ma narra, narra, narra al gran bassà  
> da Qamar az-Zaman ch'amar saprà,  
> dalla bramata lampada fatata,
>
> da Lab la maga, dall'alfana alata,  
> da Shahzamàn ch'a Samarcanda sta  
> la vasta saga araba s'avrà,  
> alla parlata franca traslata
>
> (tanta sarà la fama!) da Galland.  
> Tra casa, strada, casba, bab, bazar,  
> tra ramadan, baccan, banal tran tran,  
> rara cara ad Allàh, Bagdàd v'appar;  
> là s'affanna, s'ammalan, fan cancan  
> al-Kawz, Bàba-Abdallà, Shams an-Nahàr.

My own polyvocalic gloss (very rough) is:

> Shahrazad shall hang at dawn.  
> But till that fall she'll tell, tell, of—  
> [Kamar Zaman](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36146/page/212) who learned to love;  
> that coveted brass [lamp](https://archive.org/details/plainliteraltransup03burt/page/52), Fate's pawn;
>
> the witch-queen [Lab](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36150/page/296); the [horse](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36148/page/1) that flew...  
> At Samarkand for Shah Zaman  
> that Arab saga stretches on  
> which [A. Galland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Galland) massaged into  
>
> his (justly famed) _version française_.  
> In house, street, casbah, bab, bazaar —  
> at Ramadan and banal days —  
> Allah's own Baghdad's the star.  
> There labor, revelry, malaise;  
> there [Kuz](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36144/page/306), [Abdalla](https://archive.org/details/plainliteraltransup04burt/page/310), [Shams Nahar](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.36146/page/162).

## Chiti's _Il centunesimo canto_

Varaldo was a member of the [Oplepo](https://www.oplepo.com/), the Italian equivalent
of the French [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo). The Oplepo published
"plaquettes" of work by various members, the first twenty-four of which were collected
into the first volume of _La Biblioteca Oplepiana_ (Zanichelli, 2005).
The [second volume](https://amzn.to/3HqtiGO) (covering 2005–2014) and
the [third volume](https://amzn.to/3UpsvJb) (covering 2014–2020) were both released
in 2022 and appear to be available for purchase on Amazon. The first volume, though,
appears out of print. Thanks to Naomi Gold I managed to view a copy of the first volume
from Stanford's library... which proved only that _Shahrazad_'s fifty sonnets didn't
appear in it.

But one thing that _does_ appear in the first volume of the _Biblioteca Oplepiana_
is Luca Chiti's masterful _Il centunesimo canto_ (2001). This lengthy Borges-esque essay
describes the (fictional) discovery by one Giovanni Ciancaglini of a 101st canto
of the _Divine Comedy_,
microscopically printed in the margin between the 29th and 30th cantos of the _Inferno_,
whose unexpected contents upend the traditional understanding of Dante's theology
(thus explaining the [Trystero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49)-style
six-and-a-half-century Dantist conspiracy to simultaneously preserve and conceal
the Canto). Within this frame story we find the Canto itself. It's what's called a
[_cento_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cento_(poetry)) — a poem composed entirely
from the lines of another poem — in this case the _Divine Comedy_. For example,
the Canto's opening line "E, come l'uom che di trottare è lasso" is also the 70th line
of canto XXIV of _Purgatorio_. So, Chiti writes, it is indisputably true that Dante
wrote every line of the Canto. (And, he observes, between the competing hypotheses
"Dante wrote the Canto and scattered its lines throughout the rest of the _Comedy_"
and "Ciancaglini (or Chiti) managed to piece together a lucid 151-line poem in _terza rima_
from lines already haphazardly scattered through the _Comedy_," Occam's Razor seems
to favor the former, doesn't it? And yet. As the magician Teller is said to have said
(where?), "sometimes magic is just someone spending more time on something than
anyone else might reasonably expect.")

Chiti also provides a thorough commentary on each line of
the Canto, in most cases quoting the commentators of previous centuries; this is,
naturally, possible, since those previous commentators have _in fact_ published
commentary on every one of the Canto's lines! (Just not in that particular order.)

Luca Chiti died in 2003, just a couple years after publishing _Il centunesimo canto_.

[Paolo Albani's _Tèchne_](http://www.nuovatechne.it/ChitiIndice.html).

Figuring that the laziest way for this English-speaker to read the 66 dense pages of
_Il centunesimo canto_ was to transcribe it and
let Chrome "Translate this page," I have done so; and you too can
[read it here](https://quuxplusone.github.io/Wikisource/Chiti/il-centunesimo-canto.html).
I made an attempt to gloss the Canto itself into English, for which I relied
heavily on Robert and Jean Hollander's _Divine Comedy_ (2000, 2003, 2007).
The Hollander translation is great for this because it's already almost entirely a
line-for-line gloss. Just for giggles, here's what you get if you take _literally_
the indicated lines from the Hollander _Comedy_:

> And, as one exhausted by his run  
>  As we moved on by ourselves, a voice,  
>  From arm to arm, and between the head  
> We knew those kindly spirits heard us moving off.  
>  Among the rest I saw a shade that looked expectant,  
>  just so, if I kept silent, urged in equal measure  
> saw me and knew me and called out,  
>  before she spoke, shining with the rays of such a smile  
>  Consider, reader, whether I was struck by wonder  
> as does a man who finds his path cut off  
>  on that side of him where we have our hearts.  
>  I turned and fixed my gaze on him  
> as lying far beyond all it can see.  
>  And he: "O my son, let it not displease you  
>  that memory now would still be painful  
> that is proportional to such a part  
>  with the virtuous or even coming near them,"  
>  then turned to face my master...

Many lines match up precisely; but there are at least two kinds of problems:
First, sometimes Hollander rearranges a whole sentence so as to leave a phrase out of
place compared to the Italian. For example, line 3 above cuts off before "and foot";
line 6 comes from a stanza where Hollander collapses the rhyme-words
_me non riprendo ... né commendo_ into "I merit neither praise nor blame" on
the middle line, leaving "urged in equal measure" to fill out our line instead.
Second, I had to ensure that each of my English lines could fulfill its roles
both in its original location _and_ in the Gruccio canto. So for example on line 8
Hollander uses "she" to refer to Beatrice (_Par._ VII.17), but the Italian
_cominciò_ is genderless and in its new context needs to refer to Gruccio.
So the correct line here can't use either "he" or "she."

I was _mostly_ too lazy to rhyme — or rather, I made a brief attempt to force
rigorous rhyme, decided that the lines were getting worse instead of better,
and therefore stopped. My English version of the Canto begins:

> And, like a man who wearies in a race,  
>  we were made alone and lone went on  
>  from horn to horn, from summit to the base.  
> Taciturn — though they heard that we had gone —  
>  among the others a waiting shade I saw;  
>  thus, if I was silent, I reproach me none.  
> He saw me and he knew me and he called  
>  and began, illuminating me with a smile.  
>  Think, reader, if I was filled with awe  
> as one who finds his path cut off  
>  just where a person's heart should be.  
>  I turned to him and fixed my gaze  
> far beyond all that he could see.  
>  And he: "Don't be displeased, O son of mine,  
>  though heavy right now be that memory,  
> that it's proportioned well to such a one  
>  to reason with the good, or to approach them."  
>  And to my guide he turned his face...

To read the whole thing (and Chiti's untranslated essay and footnotes),
[go here](https://quuxplusone.github.io/Wikisource/Chiti/il-centunesimo-canto.html)
and, when you get to page 55, click the "English" button.

## A postscript on HTML footnotes

Incidentally, for heavily footnoted works like this, we have a very well-established
and user-friendly idiom _in print_ — you put the body text in the top half of each page
and the footnotes in the bottom half, possibly varying the size of each "half" from
page to page. But for HTML we lack any established idiom. The state of the art is hyperlinks
(as described by Tobias Kolditz [here](https://www.verzettelung.com/23/12/23/))
or minor variations on that theme (as described by Jake Archibald
[here](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/give-footnotes-the-boot/)).

Tobias Kolditz has a nice idea [here](https://zeitbach.com/interlinear/old/the-bet/):
the top half of the _browser screen_ is the body text, scrollable, and the
bottom half is devoted to a single footnote which changes as you mouse over (or tap)
different parts of the body text. I'd rather the bottom frame contained _all_ the
footnotes' text, scrollable, for "browsability" and searchability; but that's a minor
nit. I should sit down and implement that for a text like _Il centunesimo canto_ and
see how I like it in practice.
