Previously on this blog: ["Polycube snakes and ouroboroi"](/blog/2022/11/18/polycube-snakes/) (2022-11-18).

Preparing to add the sequences from that post into [OEIS](https://oeis.org), I realized
to my surprise that most of the 2D analogues weren't yet in OEIS either! There are several
near-miss variations, though, involving the following concepts:


## Polyominoes with holes (snakes versus strips)

Any polyomino divides the plane into one or more rookwise-connected regions. Two chess rooks
are in different regions if one cannot reach the other in any number of rookwise moves without
at some point passing through a cell of the polyomino. A polyomino which divides the plane into
$$k+1$$ regions is said to have $$k$$ holes.

The smallest polyomino with a hole is the O-heptomino... which also happens to be a polyomino snake.

![Two rooks divided by a snake](/blog/images/2022-12-08-o-heptomino.svg)

The polyomino divides the two pictured rooks from each other; therefore it is _not_ a strip.

[Miroslav Vicher](http://www.vicher.cz/puzzle/polyform/minio/polystrip.htm)
refers to polyomino snakes without holes as _strip polyominoes_. Strip polyominoes are interesting
if your main recreational interests in polyominoes are tilings and dissections, because holes pose
a problem for those tasks. The 30 free heptomino-strips can tile a pretty 14x15 rectangle:

![Image credit: Miroslav Vicher](/blog/images/2022-12-08-vicher-heptastrips.png)

but the 31 heptomino-snakes can't tile any hole-free shape at all.
Vicher notes that the 150 free
[nonomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonomino)-strips cannot tile any
rectangle, either, because the nonomino depicted below has â€” not a _hole_, but
what Vicher calls a _cave_.

![Image credit: Miroslav Vicher](/blog/images/2022-12-08-vicher-nonomino-with-cave.png)

Although the interior of the cave can be reached
by a freely moving rook, it cannot be filled by any possible combination of snakes.

OEIS sequences demonstrating the effect of holes include:

* [OEIS A049429](https://oeis.org/A049429) counts free _d_-dimensional polycubes
  * Summing across the first two columns of each row gives [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105), the count of free 2D polyominoes
  * Summing across the first three columns of each row gives [A038119](https://oeis.org/A038119), the count of free 3D polycubes
  * Summing across the first four columns of each row gives [A068870](https://oeis.org/A068870), the count of free 4D polyhypercubes


* [OEIS A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) counts free polyominoes
  * [OEIS A000104](https://oeis.org/A000104) counts free polyominoes with no holes
  * [OEIS A057418](https://oeis.org/A057418) counts free polyominoes with exactly one hole
  * [OEIS A001419](https://oeis.org/A001419) counts free polyominoes with one or more holes (i.e., [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) minus [A000104](https://oeis.org/A000104))


* [OEIS A002013](https://oeis.org/A002013) counts free snake polyominoes
  * [OEIS A333313](https://oeis.org/A333313) counts free snake polyominoes with no holes (i.e., strip polyominoes)

  * [OEIS A357083](https://oeis.org/A357083) counts free polycubes with one or more holes

(Just to confuse matters, the title of [OEIS A151514](https://oeis.org/A151514) and
a 2009 comment on [OEIS A002013](https://oeis.org/A002013) formerly used the term "strip"
when they meant "snake." But I submitted corrections and these are now fixed.)


### Holes in 3D

There are at least two ways to define the 3D equivalent of a "strip" (resp. "a snake without holes").

* The simplest kind of 3D "hole" is a fully enclosed empty region from which a 3D rook could not escape
    by 3D-rookwise moves; this is also known as a "cavity." The smallest polycube with such a cavity is
    also a snake: `SRDRURDRUR` wraps around all six faces of an empty cell, in the same way as the
    O-heptomino wraps around all four sides of an empty 2D cell.
    Similarly, the shortest polyhypercube snake with a cavity would use 15 hypercubes
    to wrap around all eight hyperfaces of an empty 4D cell; and so on.

* A different kind of 3D hole is the "donut hole": a tunnel through which you can pass a string,
    then connect the ends of the string to form a loop, such that the loop of string cannot escape
    to infinity no matter how much it wiggles. Of the three free eight-cube ouroboroi, one (the
    simplest) has a donut hole, and the other two don't. Of the two chiral ten-cube ouroboroi, one
    has a donut hole, and the other (being the polycube equivalent of a [horn torus](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HornTorus.html))
    doesn't.

* My lovely wife pointed out the donut-hole possibility; I then further observed that some polycube ouroboroi
    have what I might call "pseudo-tunnels," where the ouroboros itself actually does not circumnavigate
    the tunnel, but simply doubles back on itself. We can characterize these pseudo-tunnels by whether
    our loop of string can escape them by wiggling through _corners_, or whether it must wiggle through
    _edges_ as well. I believe the smallest polycube ouroboros with an "edge-type pseudo-tunnel" is this
    quite appropriately shaped 22-cube construction:

![Sam's heart-shaped ouroboros](/blog/images/2022-12-08-sams-heart-polycube.jpg)

A minor tweak gives a 24-cube ouroboros with a "corner-type pseudo-tunnel"; this can be reduced
to a 22-cube ouroboros (see [my followup post](/blog/2022/12/11/lego-polycube-snakes/)).


## One-sided versus free polyominoes

Whenever we talk about the distinctness of _d_-dimensional shapes, we must clarify what kinds
of rotations we're permitting.

* No rotations at all: "fixed" polyominoes
* Rotations in _d_-space but no higher: "one-sided" polyominoes
* Rotations through _d+1_-space: "two-sided" or "free" polyominoes

When counting "one-sided" 2D polyominoes, we don't allow flipping them over through 3-space: mirror images
are counted as distinct. Likewise, when counting "one-sided" 3D polycubes, we don't allow flipping them
through hyperspace: mirror images are counted as distinct. A polyform with distinct left- and right-handed
variants is called "chiral": its left- and right-handed variants are counted as two distinct one-sided polyforms,
but identified as the same free polyform.

This notion of one-sidedness is different from my previous blog post's notion
of "directed snakes," where I was distinguishing the snake's head from its tail.

> some more verbiage to explain that a "rooted snake" must have its root actually at one of

The following image shows just four free undirected polyomino snakes (the I, L, W, and Z pentominoes);
but since the L and Z are chiral, we have a total of _six_ one-sided undirected snakes in the left half
of the image. Meanwhile, variants of the L and W produce _six_ free directed/rooted snakes
across the top half of the image; and the entire image shows _nine_ examples of one-sided directed snakes.
(Of course this is just a representative sampling of the _total_ number of one-sided directed snake pentominoes.)

  * [OEIS A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) counts free polyominoes
  * [OEIS A030228](https://oeis.org/A030228) counts chiral polyominoes (i.e., [A000988](https://oeis.org/A000988) minus [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105))

* [OEIS A000162](https://oeis.org/A000162) counts one-sided polycubes ([A355966](https://oeis.org/A355966) counts those with cavities)

## Table of results (3D)

Here's a partial table of 3D polycube cases
([source code](/blog/code/2022-12-08-polycube-snakes-and-strips.cpp)).
Columns corresponding to existing OEIS sequences are marked, as above.

The table below indicates the existence of two _chiral pairs_ among the 10-cube ouroboroi.
Can you find them? How about the three different ways to enclose a cavity with a 12-cube
ouroboros (one mirror-symmetric, the other two forming a chiral pair)?
