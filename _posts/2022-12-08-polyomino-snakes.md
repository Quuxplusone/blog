Previously on this blog: ["Polycube snakes and ouroboroi"](/blog/2022/11/18/polycube-snakes/) (2022-11-18).

Preparing to add the sequences from that post into [OEIS](https://oeis.org), I realized
to my surprise that most of the 2D analogues weren't yet in OEIS either! There are several
near-miss variations, though, involving the following concepts:


## Polyominoes with holes (snakes versus strips)

Any polyomino divides the plane into one or more rookwise-connected regions. Two chess rooks
are in different regions if one cannot reach the other in any number of rookwise moves without
at some point passing through a cell of the polyomino. A polyomino which divides the plane into
$$k+1$$ regions is said to have $$k$$ holes.

The smallest polyomino with a hole is the O-heptomino... which also happens to be a polyomino snake.

![Two rooks divided by a snake](/blog/images/2022-12-08-o-heptomino.svg)

The polyomino divides the two pictured rooks from each other; therefore it is _not_ a strip.

[Miroslav Vicher](http://www.vicher.cz/puzzle/polyform/minio/polystrip.htm)
refers to polyomino snakes without holes as _strip polyominoes_. Strip polyominoes are interesting
if your main recreational interests in polyominoes are tilings and dissections, because holes pose
a problem for those tasks. The 30 free heptomino-strips can tile a pretty 14x15 rectangle:

![Image credit: Miroslav Vicher](/blog/images/2022-12-08-vicher-heptastrips.png)

but the 31 heptomino-snakes can't tile any hole-free shape at all.
Vicher notes that the 150 free
[nonomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonomino)-strips cannot tile any
rectangle, either, because the nonomino depicted below has â€” not a _hole_, but
what Vicher calls a _cave_.

![Image credit: Miroslav Vicher](/blog/images/2022-12-08-vicher-nonomino-with-cave.png)

Although the interior of the cave can be reached
by a freely moving rook, it cannot be filled by any possible combination of snakes.

> Vicher's website often uses the shorthand "polystrip" to mean "strip polyomino";
> but that's unnecessarily confusing, given the established convention of using the
> suffix to identify the base form: polyomino, polyiamond, polyabolo, polyhex.
> We can speak also of strip polyiamonds, strip polyabolos, strip polyhexes;

OEIS sequences demonstrating the effect of holes include:

* [OEIS A049429](https://oeis.org/A049429) counts free _d_-dimensional polycubes
  * Summing across the first two columns of each row gives [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105), the count of free 2D polyominoes
  * Summing across the first three columns of each row gives [A038119](https://oeis.org/A038119), the count of free 3D polycubes
  * Summing across the first four columns of each row gives [A068870](https://oeis.org/A068870), the count of free 4D polyhypercubes<br>

* [OEIS A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) counts free polyominoes
  * [OEIS A000104](https://oeis.org/A000104) counts free polyominoes with no holes
  * [OEIS A057418](https://oeis.org/A057418) counts free polyominoes with exactly one hole
  * [OEIS A001419](https://oeis.org/A001419) counts free polyominoes with one or more holes (i.e., [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) minus [A000104](https://oeis.org/A000104))<br>

* [OEIS A002013](https://oeis.org/A002013) counts free snake polyominoes
  * [OEIS A333313](https://oeis.org/A333313) counts free snake polyominoes with no holes (i.e., strip polyominoes)<br>

* [OEIS A038119](https://oeis.org/A038119) counts free polycubes
  * [OEIS A357083](https://oeis.org/A357083) counts free polycubes with one or more holes

Every polycube snake up to $$n=10$$ is also a strip.
The shortest non-strip polycube snake is the 11-cube `SRURSRSRDR`, which wraps around
all six faces of an empty 3D cell in the middle, just as the 7-square `SRSRSR` wraps around all four
sides of an empty 2D cell. By analogy, the shortest non-strip polyhypercube snake would use 15 hypercubes
to wrap around all eight hyperfaces of an empty 4D cell; and so on.

Just to confuse matters, the title of [OEIS A151514](https://oeis.org/A151514) and
a 2009 comment on [OEIS A002013](https://oeis.org/A002013) currently use the term "strip"
when they actually mean "snake." I have submitted corrections.


## One-sided versus free polyominoes

Whenever we talk about the distinctness of _d_-dimensional shapes, we must clarify what kinds
of rotations we're permitting.

* No rotations at all: "fixed" polyominoes
* Rotations in _d_-space but no higher: "one-sided" polyominoes
* Rotations through _d+1_-space: "two-sided" or "free" polyominoes

When counting "one-sided" 2D polyominoes, we don't allow flipping them over through 3-space: mirror images
are counted as distinct. Likewise, when counting "one-sided" 3D polycubes, we don't allow flipping them
through hyperspace: mirror images are counted as distinct. A polyform with distinct left- and right-handed
variants is called "chiral": its left- and right-handed variants are counted as two distinct one-sided polyforms,
but identified as the same free polyform.

This notion of one-sidedness is different from my previous blog post's notion
of "directed snakes," where I was distinguishing the snake's head from its tail.

> The mathematical term for that concept seems to be "rootedness," although you might need
> some more verbiage to explain that a "rooted snake" must have its root actually at one of
> its ends, and not somewhere in the middle.

The following image shows just four free undirected polyomino snakes (the I, L, W, and Z pentominoes);
but since the L and Z are chiral, we have a total of _six_ one-sided undirected snakes in the left half
of the image. Meanwhile, variants of the L and W produce _six_ free directed/rooted snakes
across the top half of the image; and the entire image shows _nine_ examples of one-sided directed snakes.
(Of course this is just a representative sampling of the _total_ number of one-sided directed snake pentominoes.)

![Chiral and directed snake pentominoes](/blog/images/2022-12-08-chiral-pentominoes.svg)

OEIS sequences demonstrating the effect of chirality include:

* [OEIS A000988](https://oeis.org/A000988) counts one-sided polyominoes, which is the sum of:
  * [OEIS A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105) counts free polyominoes
  * [OEIS A030228](https://oeis.org/A030228) counts chiral polyominoes (i.e., [A000988](https://oeis.org/A000988) minus [A000105](https://oeis.org/A000105))<br>

* [OEIS A000162](https://oeis.org/A000162) counts one-sided polycubes ([A355966](https://oeis.org/A355966) counts those with holes)
  * [OEIS A038119](https://oeis.org/A038119) counts free polycubes ([A357083](https://oeis.org/A357083) counts those with holes)<br>

* [OEIS A068870](https://oeis.org/A068870) counts one-sided polyhypercubes
  * [OEIS A255487](https://oeis.org/A255487) counts free polyhypercubes<br>

* [OEIS A151514](https://oeis.org/A151514) counts one-sided snake polyominoes
  * [OEIS A002013](https://oeis.org/A002013) counts free snake polyominoes<br>

* An unlisted sequence counts one-sided strip polyominoes
  * [OEIS A333313](https://oeis.org/A333313) counts free strip polyominoes

## Table of results (3D)

Here's a partial table of 3D polycube cases.
Columns corresponding to existing OEIS sequences are marked accordingly.
Blanks (except in the odd ouroboros cases) indicate that I just haven't
computed those values yet; but I'll try to update this table when I find
the time.
