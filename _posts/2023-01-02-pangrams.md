Augustus De Morgan's [_A Budget of Paradoxes_](https://books.google.com/books?id=kfPuAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA273)
contains these pangrams,
which use each letter of the English alphabet once each. Being happily
an inhabitant of Ye Olden Times, he gets to cheat by using "u" for "v"
and "i" for "j" — two extra vowels, and two of the hardest consonants
gone!

In modern times, nobody uses "j" or "v" as vowels anymore; but on the plus side,
we've got television. So we have the famous pangram

This pangram was originally ([_Word Ways_ <b>12</b>:4 (1979), "Kickshaws" column, headline "Using up the alphabet"](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol12/iss4/16/))
credited to "Clement Wood, author of the most popular rhyming dictionary [...] 91 and still active";
but the rhymer born 1888, [Clement _Richardson_ Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Wood),
in fact died in 1950. Now, there was a whole other lineage of Clement _Biddle_ Woods, of which Jr. (1925–1994)
was president of the Harvard Lampoon; perhaps the pangrammatist was one of them.
The _Word Ways_ entry of 1979 claims to have been "relayed" by [Willard Espy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_R._Espy),
who presumably ought to have known, but maybe it got muddled along the way.

In [_Word Ways_ <b>20</b>:2 (1987)](https://digitalcommons.butler.edu/wordways/vol20/iss2/11/),
Maxey Brooke presents many more variations on the pangram.
[Jeff Miller's collection](https://jeff560.tripod.com/words9.html) is also quite impressive,
as is the collection in [_Truth_ <b>19</b>:479 (March 4, 1886)](https://books.google.com/books?id=e6Y6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA353).

Last year, the Washington Post Style Invitational (now defunct) introduced me to
"Scrabblegrams," an art form mastered by [Dave Cohen](https://davesscrabblegrams.com/),
in which the goal is to make a sentence using all 100 tiles of a single Scrabble set (including the two
blanks, which can stand for any letter). I made [a little HTML helper](https://quuxplusone.github.io/Scrabblegrams/)
for producing Scrabblegrams without a physical set of tiles, which allowed me to bang out
the following bagatelle, filling in more of Mr. Jock's backstory:

> Romeo Jacques (degreed zoologist, ex-shikari, and Channel Two trivia moderator) guns up five wapiti, but barely any felines.

This is nothing on Dave, of course, who regularly — _daily!_ — composed masterpieces
such as [this](https://davesscrabblegrams.com/451835433) mnemonic for the digits of pi:

> Now I know a ratio (use X/D):
> Periphery of circle (X) above the level diameter (D).
> Justifies amazing equations.
> Got no end, arguably.
