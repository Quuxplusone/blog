From _Blackwood's Magazine_, November 1819:

> We have often congratulated ourselves on having flourished after the extinction of chivalry,
> the decline and fall of the empire of ghosts, and the introduction of potatoes into this island.
> We never could have endured a shirt of mail [...] The luxury of being negligently dressed,
> of lying diffused all day over a sofa, was then unknown. [...]
>
> Neither were there potatoes in those days — and without that vegetable, say, what were a dinner?
>
> > ["A world without a sun."](https://books.google.com/books?id=qmex__k830wC&pg=PA52)
>
> From the very bottom of our souls do we pity our ancestors. There is no
> philosophy in saying, that the universal love of the potato, did the potato
> itself create. That love must have pre-existed in the elements of our nature,
> just as the desire for Eve pre-existed in Adam, and was only called forth into
> action by that accomplished female. There must, therefore have been, ever since
> the arrival of the Saxons in this island, unknown, at least not understood, by
> our forefathers,
>
> > ["A craving void left aching at their hearts."](https://books.google.com/books?id=eytD-OR8i3cC&pg=PA180)
>
> A void which, within these last hundred years, has been filled up, so that little
> seems to be wanting, under our free government, to the perfection of our social and
> domestic happiness. It would be a curious enquiry, to show the effects of this vegetable
> on the moral, intellectual, and physical character of the people of a sister kingdom;
> and on some future occasion we hope to sift this subject to the bottom. There can
> be no doubt, that the sudden extinction of the potato in Ireland would be as fine a
> subject for a poem from the pen of Lord Byron, as the sudden extinction of light,
> some of the evils of which imaginary event his Lordship has, with his usual vigour,
> delineated in that composition entitled, ["Darkness."](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43825/darkness)

By the way, if that allusion to the extinction of the Irish potato strikes you as
prophetic, wonder not that the same also occurred to people three decades later. See
a letter to the editor, captioned
["Potatoes and Prophecy,"](https://books.google.com/books?id=HQcNAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA453)
that ran in the _Southern Literary Messenger_ of July 1848.
(That editor's name?— Edgar Allan Poe!)
