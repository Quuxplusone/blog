Last week an interesting integer sequence popped up on
[/r/CasualMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualMath/comments/11ep7ml/sequence_built_by_iterative_insertion_of_integers/)
and then OEIS: [OEIS A360447](https://oeis.org/A360447). This isn't a "numerical" sequence per se: it's a permutation of
the positive integers achieved by the following rule:

- Start with the list `0, 1, 2`.
- For each integer `i`, in order, starting with `3`, find the two adjacent integers in the list which sum to `i`
    and add `i` between them. For example, `3` goes between `1` and `2`; then `4` goes between `1` and `3`; producing
    the list `0, 1, 4, 3, 2` so far.
- Now `5` could go between `1, 4` or between `3, 2`. When you have multiple options, choose the pair with the
    smallest absolute difference: `(3 - 2) = 1` is smaller than `(4 - 1) = 3`, so `5` goes between `3` and `2`.
- Now there's no pair of adjacent integers that sums to `6`. When you have no options, just insert the integer at
    the end of the list; producing `0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6` so far.
- Consider the prefix `0, 1, 4`. Notice that the only numbers that could ever _possibly_ be inserted in between
    these elements are `1` and `5`, and we've already passed those values: we're working on `i=7` now. So `0, 1, 4`
    is guaranteed never to change after this point — it's a prefix of the "true" sequence OEIS A360447.

You can compute this sequence by brute force something like this:

    std::vector<int> v = {0, 1, 2};
    for (int i=3; i < MAX; ++i) {
        auto p = find_insertion_point(v, i);
        v.insert(p, i);
    }

But finding the insertion point, with no other bookkeeping to speed the computation, takes O(n) time.
So does `v.insert`. We can do vastly better with an algorithm like this:

    std::list<int> v = {0, 1, 2};
    std::map<int, ListIterator> sums = {
        { 3, std::prev(v.end()) },
    };
    for (int i=3; i < MAX; ++i) {
        auto it = sums.find(i);
        if (it == sums.end()) {
            v.push_back(i);
            maybe_update_sums(std::prev(v.end()));
        } else {
            auto p = it->second;
            p = v.insert(p, i);
            sums.erase(it);
            maybe_update_sums(p);
            maybe_update_sums(std::next(p));
        }
    }

where `maybe_update_sums(pos)` checks to see if `pos` is now the best place to insert the number `i` in the future,
and if so, updates the `sums` map with `{ i, pos }`.

Using this algorithm, we're bottlenecked mainly on memory — and what a bottleneck it is! We can save some memory by
observing that we'll never look up any integer bigger than `MAX` in `sums`, so we never have to insert sums bigger
than `MAX` into `sums`. We can save more memory, and also save a lot of time, by switching from `std::list` to
`std::forward_list`: a list node holding an `int` plus a `next` pointer is only 66% the size of a list node holding
that `int` plus `next` and `prev` pointers. It turns out we can also save a lot of time by switching from `std::map`
to `std::unordered_map`.

In fact, we can save _the most_ memory by switching both of our data structures to completely preallocated
arrays of int: The "list" structure becomes an array where `next_[i] == j` indicates that the integer `j` follows
the integer `i` in our current list. The "map" structure becomes an array where `data_[s] == i` if and only if
`i + next_[i] == s`. This lowers our memory usage to the probably-minimal `2*MAX` integers (where `MAX` is the
number of integers we'll insert into our list before stopping and reporting our results).

Find a snapshot of my code [here](/blog/code/2023-03-05-oeis-a360447.cpp). On my laptop, the
STL `forward_list`/`unordered_map` version chugs through the first 100 million integers, producing entries
`a(0)=0` through `a(59)=44289045` of OEIS A360447, in 49 seconds. The "most custom" version, using preallocated
arrays for both data structures, does the same in 4.5 seconds.

Tackling the first billion integers, it produces `a(95)=362806936`
in 60 seconds:

`a(96)=1345208697` takes another five minutes beyond that.
At that point, the list-so-far continues:

    1345208697, (982401761, 1601996586, 619594825, ...)

and `2327610458` is in fact inserted between `1345208697`
and `982401761`. Whether `3672819155` will be inserted between
`1345208697` and `2327610458`, I don't know — I run out of RAM
before then.

## Update (2023-03-08)

Christian Sievers made the excellent observation that we don't even need
two distinct data structures — all we need is a single array of `Int`, where the
`i`th element of the array holds the successor of integer `i` in the list if it's
already been inserted, or the (currently anticipated) predecessor of `i` if it
hasn't yet been inserted. A single pass over the array constructs the whole list.
using only two loads and two stores for elements added at the back of the list,
and three loads and four stores for elements added in the middle. The resulting
program feels very _[TAOCP](https://amzn.to/3T1DrLr)_.

The new and improved code is available [here](/blog/code/2023-03-05-oeis-a360447-revised.cpp).
