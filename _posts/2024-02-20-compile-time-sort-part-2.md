Yesterday, in ["Sorting `integer_sequence` at compile time"](/blog/2024/02/19/compile-time-sort-benchmark/) (2024-02-19),
I wrote:

So I had written a helper function to get each individual element of the result one by one, like this:

    template<class> struct Sort;
    template<int... Is> struct Sort<Vector<Is...>> {
      static constexpr int GetNthElement(int i) {
        int arr[] = {Is...};
        std::ranges::sort(arr);
        return arr[i];
      }
      template<class> struct Helper;
      template<int... Indices> struct Helper<Vector<Indices...>> {
        using type = Vector<GetNthElement(Indices)...>;
      };
      using type = Helper<Iota<sizeof...(Is)>>::type;
    };

Alert reader "Chlorie" writes in to tell me the proper approach. We just need our helper to return
a `std::array` of all the elements at once, and then — still — use a pack-expansion to unpack
the elements out of that constexpr `std::array` and into `Vector`'s template argument list.
(Here we use `std::array`, not `int[]`, [despite my usual advice](/blog/2022/10/16/prefer-core-over-library/#prefer-core-language-arrays-over-stdarray),
because we need something that can be returned from a function.) [Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/zqx5s9js7):

    template<int N> struct Array { int data[N]; };

    template<class> struct Sort;
    template<int... Is> struct Sort<Vector<Is...>> {
      static constexpr auto sorted = []() {
        Array<sizeof...(Is)> arr = {Is...};
        std::ranges::sort(arr.data);
        return arr;
      }();

      template<class> struct Helper;
      template<int... Indices> struct Helper<Vector<Indices...>> {
        using type = Vector<sorted.data[Indices]...>;
      };
      using type = Helper<Iota<sizeof...(Is)>>::type;
    };

Now that `sort` is called only once, we have a truly $$O(n\log n)$$ compile-time sorting operation.

## Updated compile-time benchmark

Yesterday's benchmark is still [here](/blog/code/2024-02-19-benchmark.py);
but I've [updated it](/blog/code/2024-02-20-benchmark.py)
to include Chlorie's proper $$O(n\log n)$$ constexpr solution, using both `std::sort` and `std::ranges::sort`.

Here's Clang trunk (the future Clang 19) with libc++, running on my MacBook.
The new solutions are the orange and red lines closest to the X-axis. The orange and red
lines higher up (unchanged from yesterday's graph) are yesterday's `std::sort` and `std::ranges::sort`
solutions, which do basically $$n$$ times as much work as today's solutions.

Here's GCC 12.2 with libstdc++, running on RHEL 7.1.
There's still a noticeable compile-time-perf difference between libstdc++'s `sort` and `ranges::sort`,
but even `ranges::sort` (in orange) now wins handily against yesterday's recursive-template selection sort (in black).
