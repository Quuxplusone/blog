  satirically of a poet who had written—

  > "that part of the history of King Arthur of England which
  > Archbishop Turpin left unwritten, together with the history of the quest of the Holy Grail;
  > and all in heroic verse, part in rhymes and part in blank verse; but entirely dactylically—I
  > mean in dactylic noun substantives, without admitting any verb whatsoever."

  the word "dactylic" ("_todo ... en esdrújulos_") referred only to the line-terminal stress pattern, not
  to the contents of his dictionary. But what if he _had_ meant those constraints in the most restrictive
  sense possible? Discarding (read: forgetting) the "part in rhymes" constraint, he might have written
  something like the following, which one might in dactylic substantives christen the _Turpentine Comedy_:
