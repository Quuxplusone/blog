I'd love to see Kim's space-filling quadruple-snake configuration â€” Gardner doesn't show it, even when
he reprinted this column with addenda in
[_The Last Recreations_](https://archive.org/details/the-last-recreations/page/274/mode/1up) (1997) and
[_The Colossal Book of Mathematics_](https://books.google.com/books?id=orz0SDEakpYC&pg=PA203) (2001).
I have [asked Math StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4577337/filling-space-with-polycube-snakes)
in case anyone there knows. Someone else is also interested:

## Enumerating polycube snakes

The number of [polycubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycube) of a given size,
like the number of polyominoes, is well-studied: [OEIS A000162](https://oeis.org/A000162).
How many polycube _snakes_ are there of a given size?

Every polycube of size less than 4 is a snake. At size 4, we already run into a fiddly difficulty!
Certainly the I, L, and Z tetracubes, and the two "twists" that the [Soma cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube)
calls A and B, are snakes. But what about the square ([smashboy](https://nerdist.com/article/jeopardy-fake-tetris-name-error/))?
Its head adjoins its tail, making it a non-snake if our rule is that no cube may adjoin any cube except its neighbors.
But by Martin Gardner's definition above, the square _is_ a snake: each cube adjoins no more than
two others. We might call the square tetromino a _polycube ouroboros_.

A checkerboard argument proves there are no polycube ouroboroi of odd sizes. There is one ouroboros of
size 6, made by removing two opposite corners from a 2x2x2 arrangement (or equivalently, stacking two
V-tricubes on top of each other). There are three ouroboroi of size 8; one, made by stacking two twists
on top of each other, is shown below. And there are 13 ouroboroi of size 10.

![Two polycube ouroboroi](/blog/images/2022-11-18-polycube-ouroboroi.jpg)

For a non-ouroboros, we have a choice to distinguish one of the two end cubes as the "head"
(a "directed polycube snake"), or to leave them undifferentiated (an "undirected polycube snake").
For example, the L-tetromino corresponds to two distinguishable directed snakes: one with its head
on the short leg of the L, and one with its head on the long leg. But the I-tetromino (four cubes
in a straight line) corresponds to only one directed snake.

I suppose we could also consider "directed ouroboroi," by designating the head and tail cubes
of an ouroboros; this would result in _two_ directed hexacube ouroboroi, `SRDRD` and `SRURU`, and
the eight-cube ouroboros depicted above corresponds to no less than _four_ directed
ouroboroi!

I wrote a quick-and-dirty C++20 program to enumerate polycube snakes and undirected ouroboroi
([source code](/blog/code/2022-11-18-polysnake.cpp)). It produced the following table:

| Cubes | Directed non-ouroboroi | Undirected non-ouroboroi | Undirected ouroboroi |

## Notes on the C++ program

We can represent a snake using notation inspired by
Albie Fiore's _Shaping [Rubik's Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Snake)_ (1981).
Peer down one end of the snake and move your eye along the segments, recording at each transition
whether you need to turn left, right, up, down, or straight (and rotating the whole snake
each time to keep the current cube in front of your eye).
In this notation the two tricube snakes are `SS` and `SR`;
the undirected tetracube snakes are `SSS`, `SRS`, `SRL`, `SRU`, `SRD`, and the ouroboros `SRR`;
and the hexacube ouroboros can be represented as `SRDRD`.

The above letter-strings are all in "canonical form": they begin with `S`, and the
first turning we come to (if any) is always an `R`. It's possible to represent the
V-tricube "non-canonically" as `SL` or `SU` or even `LR`, but that would be confusing,
so let's not.

The undirected L-tetracube can be represented as either `SRS` (starting on the short leg)
or `SSR` (starting on the long leg); I arbitrarily choose the string that comes
first alphabetically as the unique representative of its equivalence class.

So, the program's job is essentially to generate all possible $$(n-1)$$-character letter-strings,
and then winnow out the ones that aren't in canonical form, and then further winnow out the
ones that aren't snakes (for example, `SSRURU`'s second cube has three neighbors). This produces
a list of directed snakes and/or ouroboroi. For non-ouroboroi, we must then compare the snake
to its own reversal to avoid double-counting it. De-duplicating ouroboroi, which have
no designated head or tail at all, is more tedious.

To generate the initial stock of `strings_of_length(n)`,
I initially used a C++20 coroutine â€” a function returning a `generator<string_view>`
onto a `string` stored in the coroutine frame. This was one of my first forays
into coroutines, and I found it quite painless for this use-case.
The code for `generator` is given in
["Announcing `Quuxplusone/coro`"](/blog/2019/07/03/announcing-coro-examples/) (2019-07-03).
The caveat here is that it would have been just as easy in this case _not_ to use coroutines;
and when I factored out `odometer(s)` into its own function and got rid of the
then-trivial coroutine wrapper, things got 1% faster.

This was also the first time I've used C++20 `std::span<T>`, and again it seemed
like the right tool for the job; although I also have a nagging feeling that my
code went overboard on all the `string_view`s and `span`s and maybe there could
have been a better way to organize it from the beginning.

To winnow out duplicate snakes,
at first I wrote a function `string canonical_reversal(string_view)` to actually
_produce_ the reversal of a snake (for example, the reversal of `SSR` is `SRS`),
but eventually I realized that all we do is compare that reversal to the original
string and bail out if the reversal is alphabetically less â€” so we don't actually
have to _build_ the reversed string at all! Instead of

    for each step i of the reversed snake:
      compute the next letter L
      RS[i] = L
    finally, return (S <= RS)

we can simply do

    for each step i of the reversed snake:
      compute the next letter L
      if L != S[i]:
        return (S[i] < L)
    return true

This not only saves memory accesses on `RS`, but also short-circuits quite a bit
of the loop.

My next optimization was to notice that no valid snake (except smashboy) can ever contain
the substrings `RR`, `LL`, `UU`, or `DD`; so any time our odometer algorithm creates
such a substring, we should "fast-forward" in constant time to the next string. Of course
we should also fast-forward any time we create a non-canonical letter-string, such as
`SSLSS`; we should skip straight to `SRSSS` in that case.

With these algorithmic optimizations, on my laptop, the above program can enumerate
all 64,380,796 undirected sixteen-cube snakes (and all 12,562 ouroboroi) in just over a minute.

----

One more optimization is worthy of consideration: Each directed snake of length $$n+1$$
can be constructed by appending one cube to the tail of some directed snake of length $$n$$,
and each undirected snake of length $$n+1$$ can be constructed by appending one cube to the
head or tail of some undirected non-ouroboros of length $$n$$.
So, to find the snakes of length 17, we wouldn't have to run through all
$$742\,803\,769$$ letter-strings produced by our optimized odometer; we'd only have to check
$$10\times 64\,380\,796 = 643\,807\,960$$ or even $$5\times 128\,743\,825 = 643\,719\,125$$
possibilities. However, the naÃ¯ve way of doing this involves having one pass _store_ all of
the snakes of length $$n$$ so that the next pass can use them to find snakes of length $$n+1$$,
and "storing all the snakes" doesn't scale: for $$n=20$$ the number of undirected
non-ouroboroi is almost 18 billion. So I'm afraid I don't see a good way to incorporate
this idea.
