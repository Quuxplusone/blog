A quotation from the preface to Donald Knuth's _The TeXBook_
([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3AcE3Zv), [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/B-001-002-139/page/n6/mode/1up)):

This sentiment has stuck with me. I recently found its distant ancestor in
Dante Alighieri's [_Quaestio de aquae et terrae_](https://archive.org/details/atranslationqua00aliggoog/page/n54/mode/2up) (c. 1320):

> aliae duae [figurae] superiores falsae; et positae sunt, non quia sic sit,
> sed ut sentiat discens, ut ille dicit in primo _Priorum_.
>
> [“The two preceding figures are false; and they are introduced, not because
> they are correct, but that the learner may understand, as he says in the
> first of the _Priors_.”]

This in turn refers to Aristotle's _Prior Analytics_ (I.xli), in which the philosopher
[writes](https://archive.org/details/L325AristotleIPriorAnalytics/page/384/mode/2up):

> We do not base our argument upon the reality of a particular example;
> we are doing the same as the geometrician who says that such-and-such
> a one-foot line or straight line or line without breadth exists when it does not,
> yet does not use his illustrations in the sense that he argues from them. [...]
> On the contrary, we (I mean the student) use the setting out of terms
> as one uses sense-perception; we do not use them as though demonstration
> were impossible without these illustrations.

Now, Aristotle was simply saying that "examples are non-normative": if I provide an
illustration in support of a principle, and you dispute that particular illustration,
the principle itself may yet be correct. (This differs from logic, where if
you knock down one of my premises, my conclusion goes with it.)

Dante wants to present a particular concrete theory about the distribution of water
on the earth. He does this by first presenting two _competing hypotheses_, neither of
which is correct, solely for the purpose of knocking them down, before he reveals
his own theory. Seeing the holes in the earlier versions helps the student
understand the final version.

Knuth also wants to present a particular concrete system. He does this by first
presenting an _oversimplified version_ of the system — so oversimplified that it
is, in fact, incorrect — to give the student the general gist of the system.
Seeing a consistent general plan up front (even though it errs in some particulars)
helps the student understand the final version.

In this Knuth differs from Einstein, who famously said,
"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."
(Well, [sort of](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/05/13/einstein-simple/).
In _On the Method of Theoretical Physics_ (1933) he [wrote](https://archive.org/details/structureofscien0000unse_i7r3/page/82):
"[T]he supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements
as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate
representation of a single datum of experience.") Knuth, on the other hand,
says that you _should_ make things simpler than possible, at least at first,
because that's the best way to plant the seed of understanding.

To put Knuth's approach in the form of a [grook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grook):

> When your topic is arcane  
> and on it you’d shed light,  
> First make it wronger ’til it’s plain,  
> Then weirder ’til it's right.
