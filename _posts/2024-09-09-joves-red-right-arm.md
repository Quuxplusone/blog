excerpt: |
  In Milton's _Paradise Lost_, [book II](https://milton.host.dartmouth.edu/reading_room/pl/book_2/text.shtml) (1667),
  Belial counsels against an assault on Heaven:

  > What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires  
  > Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage  
  > And plunge us in the flames? or from above  
  > Should intermitted vengeance arm again  
  > His <b>red right hand</b> to plague us?

  This last image is lifted from Horace's [_Odes_ I.2](https://archive.org/details/odesepodes0000hora_w9j4/page/n31/mode/2up):

  > Iam satis terris nivis atque dirae  
  > grandinis misit Pater et <b>rubente</b>  
  > <b>dextera</b> sacras iaculatus arces  
  > terruit urbem [...]

In Milton's _Paradise Lost_, [book II](https://milton.host.dartmouth.edu/reading_room/pl/book_2/text.shtml) (1667),
Belial counsels against an assault on Heaven:

> What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires  
> Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage  
> And plunge us in the flames? or from above  
> Should intermitted vengeance arm again  
> His <b>red right hand</b> to plague us?

This last image is lifted from Horace's [_Odes_ I.2](https://archive.org/details/odesepodes0000hora_w9j4/page/n31/mode/2up):

> Iam satis terris nivis atque dirae  
> grandinis misit Pater et <b>rubente</b>  
> <b>dextera</b> sacras iaculatus arces  
> terruit urbem [...]

> Enough already of dire snow and hail  
> has the Father sent upon the earth,  
> and smiting with his <b>red right hand</b>  
> the sacred hill-tops has filled with fear the city [...]

Interestingly, Horace's "red right arm" image was, by not just one but two nineteenth-century poets,
transposed from I.2 to [_Odes_ III.3](https://archive.org/details/odesepodes0000hora_w9j4/page/178/mode/2up) —

> Iustum et tenacem propositi virum  
> non civium ardor prava iubentium,  
> &nbsp; non vultus instantis tyranni  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; mente quatit solida neque Auster,  
> dux inquieti turbidus Hadriae,  
> nec <b>fulminantis magna manus Iovis</b>  
> &nbsp; si fractus inlabatur orbis,  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; impavidum ferient ruinae.

For the above Latin, [Byron](https://archive.org/details/worksbyro05byrouoft/page/104) gives us:

> The man of firm and noble soul  
> No factious clamours can control;  
> No threatening tyrant's darkling brow  
> Can swerve him from his just intent:  
> Gales the warring waves which plough,  
> By Auster on the billows spent,  
> To curb the Adriatic main,  
> Would awe his fix'd determined mind in vain.
>
> Ay, and the <b>red right arm of Jove</b>,  
> Hurtling his lightnings from above,  
> With all his terrors then unfurl'd,  
> He would unmoved, unawed behold:  
> The flames of an expiring world,  
> Again in crashing chaos roll'd,  
> In vast promiscuous ruin hurl'd,  
> Might light his glorious funeral pile:  
> Still dauntless midst the wreck of earth he'd smile.

And [Tennyson](https://archive.org/details/rhythmwillinvict0000camp/page/25) (c. 1823) — whose idol Byron died,
aged 36, when Tennyson was only 14 himself) has:

> The people's fury cannot move  
> The man of just and steadfast soul  
> &nbsp; For he can brook  
> &nbsp; The tyrant's look  
> And <b>red right-arm</b> of mighty Jove [...]

Hat tip to the quite interesting journal article

(A. A. Markley, _Studies in Philology_, 1998).

From Horace and Milton (I guess?) "the red right arm of Jove" becomes a stock image.
Alexander Pope somewhat anachronistically inserts it into his (1726) translation of Homer's _Odyssey_ XXIV:

> With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along,  
> Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong.  
> But <b>Jove's red arm</b> the burning thunder aims:  
> Before Minerva shot the livid flames;  
> Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired [...]

And when Joseph Addison, in his Latin ["Battle of the Pygmies and Cranes"](https://books.google.com/books?id=wE4VAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA558) (c. 1690),
writes merely "_flagrantia tela deorsum torquentur Jovis acta manu_,"
[Thomas Newcomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Newcomb)'s translation (1724) inserts
"the dreadful red right-hand of Jove" and
[William Warburton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Warburton) (also 1724) says
"Jove's red arm."

William Julius Mickle [inserts](https://sacred-texts.com/neu/lus/lusbk05.htm) "Jove's red arm" into his (c. 1776) translation of Camões'
_Lusiad_ [V.58](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3333).

Meanwhile, [TVTropes went with the phrase](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand)
as the "trope namer" for something else entirely — the trope of the abnormally-handed villain
(Captain Hook, Darth Vader, Count Rugen), or perhaps any evil deformity in general.
I'm not sure how they settled on Horace's phrase to represent _that_ trope!

Serendipitously in light of Milton's 1667 date, it seems that the first observations of
a great red _spot_ on the _planet_ Jupiter are [generally dated](https://www.aps.org/archives/publications/apsnews/202005/history.cfm)
to 1664 (Robert Hooke) and 1665 (Giovanni Cassini). However, while both Hooke and Cassini recorded some kind of spot
on Jupiter, neither one specifically recorded it as red; and in fact Hooke's "spot" was more likely
just the shadow of a transiting Callisto.
