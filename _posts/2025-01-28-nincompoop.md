  In HBO's [_Bored to Death_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_to_Death) episode S2E5 "Forty-Two Down," protagonist Jonathan Ames (Jason Schwartzman)
  introduces himself to his target Vikram (Ajay Naidu) by asking his help with that day's _New York Times_
  crossword. We get two brief shots of the crossword itself. The first, a closeup, is just enough to irk
  the crossworders in the audience, as we see a plethora of unkeyed letters. The second medium shot shows
  that the black squares in this [asymmetric grid](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Thumbs?select=symmetry)
  spell out the word "HIT." (Or does the black blob in front of the "H" represent a fourth letter?)

  The episode aired 2010-10-24, but the _Times_ shown is mostly the issue of Wednesday 2007-11-14:
  the facing column contains [Mike Hale's review](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/arts/television/14hale.html)
  of the TV show _Kenny vs. Spenny_, and the "Answer to Previous Puzzle" at lower left is indeed
  [Fred Piscop's puzzle of 2007-11-13](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/13/2007).
  The crossword, however, is completely doctored — I see no resemblance to
  [the Jim Page puzzle](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=11/14/2007) that actually ran
  on that date. The clues (which do not match the grid) are hilariously zany!

Here's the crossword as best I can make it out, with all of the answers Jonathan
has (ineptly) filled in so far. ([Download as TeX](/blog/code/2025-01-28-nincompoop.tex); [PDF](/blog/code/2025-01-28-nincompoop.pdf).)

![The crossword, cleaned up](/blog/images/2025-01-28-nincompoop.png)

The Across clues seem entirely parodic; I can't think of words that would fit any
of these clues, except that "Chemical found in some emetics" might be IPECAC.
"Goatherd's undergarment"? "Wombat-like ruminant"?
"Etruscan tuber"?
For "Hungarian flautist Proog," Jonathan has filled in the name ICTO.
Some of the Across clues incorporate crosswordese tropes while remaining
nonsensical: "Snide, to a Scot"; "Amateur proctologist's grp."

But more than half of the Down clues are real: Jonathan has correctly
filled in "Rubber ducky's place" (BATH) and "Canyon sound" (ECHO),
and the three after that are obviously SLED, PIER, and INNING.
So Jonathan's guess for 1-Across "Juice of a clam" — BESPI — turns out to be correct!

The same pattern appears in the upper right corner: 10-Down is
obviously BLINK, 11-Down LAND, 12-Down OHIO; but this forms
no coherent words going across. And middle left: GIRLS, OCEAN,
ITALY. And lower right: AFRO, GAIN(?), UKES, BELA.

42 Down is "A silly, foolish, or stupid person," ten letters, of which Jonathan
has (somehow) gotten the POOP part without the NINCOM.

"Like some statistics" is VITAL (from the NYT puzzle of [1999-04-16](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=4/16/1999));
"Breathing organ" is not LUNG but GILL (from [1996-02-01](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=2/1/1996));
and "What candles may signify" is AGE (from [1998-09-27](https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=9/27/1998)).

RALANDOE (or maybe RACANDOE) and SUTRACAL don't make any sense to me.
67- and 58-Across together spell the name of contemporary BBC reporter
[JANE CORBIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Corbin),
for whatever that's worth.
