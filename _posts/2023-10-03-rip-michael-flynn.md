Sad news: I've just heard that Michael F. Flynn, sci-fi writer and long-form blogger
under the handle "The OFloinn," [died](https://web.archive.org/web/20231003210630/https://tofspot.blogspot.com/2023/10/wonder-and-anticipation-likes-of-which.html)
earlier this week. I first mentioned his writing in
["What I'm reading lately: Dogs and Wolfe"](/blog/2023/07/01/blog-roundup/) (2023-07-01);
I'd only just encountered it, but it was right up my alley<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">1</span></sup> —
deep dives into philosophy antique and/or scholastic, larded with offhand references to
Chesterton, Belloc, Gilbert, Sayers, and Tom Lehrer. Flynn also produced, over the previous three decades,
[many award-winning science fiction stories and novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn_bibliography).

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><sup>1</sup> Except for the font size.</span>

This might be an appropriate week to read, or re-read, one of TOF's long-form blogs,
such as:
