In [this 2005 message to the unicode-ml mailing list](https://unicode.org/mail-arch/unicode-ml/y2005-m11/0060.html),
Ken Whistler explains the origin of the "U+1234" notation
(hat tip Corentin Jabot):

> The use of the U+xxxx notation in publications goes back to
> Unicode 1.0 (1991), where it was explicitly used, and explained on
> p. xv:
>
> > An individual Unicode value is expressed as U+nnnn, where
> > nnnn is a four digit number in hexadecimal notation [...]
>
> The usage appears in draft documents from late 1989,
> so the convention itself dates back to then. [...]
>
> What is little-known generally is that the "U+" convention itself
> was an ASCII-fied compromise for what the Unicode designers
> *really* wanted to use for the Unicode hexadecimal prefix,
> which was [U+228E MULTISET UNION](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/228e/index.htm) (whose glyph is a union sign
> with a plus sign in it). That symbol can actually be spotted in
> some of the early Unicode collateral (T-shirts, stationery,
> business cards, etc.), because it was used as part of the original
> Unicode logo design, before the switch to the now ubiquitous
> [Uni design](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Unicode_logo.svg)
> that has been used for more than a decade.

> The semantic appropriateness of MULTISET UNION as a designator
> for Unicode code points ought to be apparent, and the shape of
> the union symbol itself was iconic for the "U" of Unicode. But
> use of the symbol in data files and documentation in the
> early days was problematical, of course, and it soon gave way
> to the much more practical use of "U+" instead.

Can you imagine writing "⊎228E MULTISET UNION" instead of
"U+228E MULTISET UNION"? I think it's both fortunate and inevitable
that that idea never took off. (For those whose fonts lack it,
we're talking about the $$\uplus$$ glyph.)

From around the web, I highly recommend this "wildly over-researched" dive into the
hyperlocal history of Minneapolis:

* ["The Mystery of the Bloomfield Bridge"](https://tylervigen.com/the-mystery-of-the-bloomfield-bridge) (Tyler Vigen, August 2023)

And speaking of deep dives, this surprisingly long and detailed history of the Stuka bomber:

* ["Screaming Bird of Prey: How the Ju-87 Stuka exceeded its life span..."](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2018/06/20/screaming-bird-of-prey-how-the-ju-87-stuka-exceeded-its-life-span-and-carried-the-luftwaffe-through-wwii/) (Stephan Wilkinson, September 2013)

Finally, this take on the [Gino scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesca_Gino),
by the apparently always entertaining Adam Mastroianni:

* ["I'm so sorry for psychology's loss, whatever it is"](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/im-so-sorry-for-psychologys-loss) (Adam Mastroianni, August 2023)

> This is really weird. Imagine if someone told you that 60% of your loved ones had died in a plane crash.
> Your first reaction might be disbelief and horror — "Why were 60% of my loved ones on the same plane?
> Were they all hanging out without me?" — but then you would want to know who died. Because that really matters!
> The people you love are not interchangeable! Was it your mom, your best friend, or what? It would be insane

> respond, "Hmm, you know, I never really looked into it. Maybe, um, Uncle Fred? Or my friend Clarissa?
> It was definitely 60% of my loved ones, though, whoever it was."
>
> So if you hear that 60% of papers in your field don’t replicate, shouldn't you care a lot about which ones?
> Why didn't my colleagues and I immediately open up that paper's supplement, click on the 100 links,
> and check whether any of our most beloved findings died? The answer has to be, "We just didn't think
> it was an important thing to do."
