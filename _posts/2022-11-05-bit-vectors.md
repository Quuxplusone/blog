Recently on the std-proposals mailing list, Madhur Chauhan [proposed](https://lists.isocpp.org/std-proposals/2022/10/4916.php)
that C++ needs a better way to find the first set bit in an arbitrary-length bit-string.
Today, if you want to manipulate bit-strings of length `N`, you have these options:

* For `N <= 64`, use `unsigned long long`.
* On some platforms, for `N <= 128`, use `__uint128`.
* On Clang 13, use `_ExtInt(N)`. (Clang 14 drops support for `N > 128`, which removes any reason to use `_ExtInt` as far as I know.)
* Use something like my [`Wider<T>`](/blog/2020/02/13/wide-integer-proof-of-concept/), which is statically sized and stack-allocated.
* Use `std::bitset<N>`, which is statically sized and stack-allocated.
* Use `std::vector<bool>`, which is dynamically resizeable and heap-allocated.
* Use [`boost::dynamic_bitset<>`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/libs/dynamic_bitset/dynamic_bitset.html), which is dynamically resizeable and heap-allocated.

Suppose we have a bit-string stored in one of these ways, and we want to
find the second-lowest 1-bit.

We'll generalize the problem by defining a function `f(n, x)` that finds the lowest
1-bit in `x` whose index is greater than or equal to the given index `n`, or returns
some large value if no such 1-bit exists.
The original problem, of finding the index of the second-lowest 1-bit in `x`, becomes:

    y = f(f(0, x) + 1, x);
    if (y < N) ~~~

Here are the current state-of-the-art methods for implementing `f`, as far as I know.
Notice that I'll use `int` for bit indices, since 2147483647 bits
[ought to be enough for anyone](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/09/08/640k-enough/).
[Godbolt:](https://godbolt.org/z/qzvsdYx5E)

    int f(int n, unsigned long long x) {
        return n >= N ? N : std::countr_zero(x >> n) + n;
    }

    #ifndef _MSC_VER
    static int f(int n, __uint128_t x) {
        constexpr unsigned long long mask = ~0uLL;
        return (x == 0) ? 128 :
               (n < 64 && (x & mask) != 0) ?
                   std::countr_zero((unsigned long long)(x >> n)) + n :
               f(n - 64, x >> 64) + 64;
    }
    #endif

    int f(int n, const Wider<T>& x) {
        Wider<T> mask = Wider<T>(1) << n;
        for (int i = n; i < N; ++i, mask <<= 1) {
            if (x & mask) return i;
        }
        return N;
    }

    int f(int n, const std::bitset<N>& x) {
    #ifdef __GLIBCXX__
        return (n == 0) ? x._Find_first() : x._Find_next(n-1);
    #else
        for (int i = n; i < N; ++i) {
            if (x[i]) return i;
        }
        return N;
    #endif
    }

    static int f(int n, const std::vector<bool>& x) {
        if (n >= N) return N;
        return std::find(x.begin() + n, x.end(), true) - x.begin();
    }

    static int f(int n, const boost::dynamic_bitset<>& x) {
        if (n >= N) return N;
        return (n == 0) ? x.find_first() : x.find_next(n-1);
    }

For `unsigned long long`, we can't _just_ call `std::countr_zero(x >> n)`
because `n` might be out of range, making `x >> n` undefined behavior.

libc++ provides `std::countr_zero` for `__uint128_t`, but GNU libstdc++ does not,
and MSVC doesn't support `__uint128_t` at all. See also
["Is `__int128` integral?"](/blog/2019/02/28/is-int128-integral/) (2019-02-28).

GNU libstdc++ provides implementation-detail methods `_Find_first` and `_Find_next`
on `std::bitset`, with exactly the same semantics as the public `find_first`
and `find_next` methods on `boost::dynamic_bitset`. Oddly, libstdc++ does not
provide those methods for their `vector<bool>`, even though the two types' elements
are laid out in the same way.

## STL algorithms for bit iterators

libc++ provides clever specializations of certain STL algorithms for bit iterators
specifically, so that they can exploit full-word-length instructions instead of
extracting "elements" bit by bit. For example, [`std::find` can use `rep bsfq`](https://godbolt.org/z/dn5PGM6T9),
and [`std::count` can use `popcntq`](https://godbolt.org/z/zx6nrfb8o).
The full list of algorithms that libc++ optimizes is:
[`std::find`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L253-L261),
[`count`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L327-L335),
[`fill`, `fill_n`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L400-L422),
[`copy`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L551-L559),
[`copy_backward`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L696-L704),
[`move`, `move_backward`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L708-L724),
[`swap_ranges`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L878-L887),
[`rotate`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L923-L970), and
[`equal`](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ed2d364/libcxx/include/__bit_reference#L1099-L1107).
Oddly, as of this writing libc++ does not optimize `std::mismatch` for bit iterators, even though
`mismatch` can be considered a building block of `equal`. Maybe a `mismatch` optimization will be added
along the way to implementing `vector<bool>::operator<=>`.
Even more oddly, libc++ fails to optimize
`copy_n`, so in Clang 15 `std::copy(first, first+n, dest)` [is 1000x faster](https://godbolt.org/z/d57e763bx)
than `std::copy_n(first, n, dest)` when `first` is a bit iterator.
I've submitted a patch for the issue and expect it'll be fixed soon.

> You might expect libraries also to specialize `std::all_of`, `any_of`, and `none_of`.
> The problem with those algorithms is that they don't default their `Predicate` argument:

> Thus, on libc++, `std::count(v.begin(), v.end(), false) == 0` will run much faster than

Microsoft STL optimizes `fill`, `fill_n`, `find`, and `count` for bit iterators.
(Search [the code](https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/705265e007283870b648856579c99f3fbc748593/stl/inc/xutility)
for uses of `_Is_vb_iterator`.)

libstdc++ optimizes only [`std::fill`](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/72886fc/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/stl_bvector.h#L1562-L1580)
for bit iterators.

From the vantage point of 2022, you might think that `std::bitset<N>` is to `std::vector<bool>`
in the same way that `std::array<T, N>` is to `std::vector<T>`. That is, it uses stack storage
with a fixed size instead of dynamic storage, but ought to provide basically the same iterator API
otherwise. Sadly, this is not the case!

`std::bitset` is one of those "not quite really STL" types, like `std::string` and `std::valarray`,
that tries to fit a couple of use-cases but none of them are "STL iterable container." Arguably, the
hint is in its name: whereas `vector<bool>` is clearly a _vector_, a sequence container, of boolean values,
`bitset` is a _set_, a collection of small integer indices. `bs.test(42)` is the equivalent of `s.find(42)`;
`bs.set(42)` is the equivalent of `s.insert(42)`; and so on. (As usual, these named methods throw
`std::out_of_range` on error, and `bitset` provides `operator[]` for faster unchecked access.)

If you were going to iterate over the "contents" of such an object, what would you expect to see?

    std::bitset<1000> bs;
    bs.set(42);
    for (auto elt : bs) {
        std::cout << bs;
    }

Surely you wouldn't expect to see "false, false, false, false, ..."!
So `std::bitset` (and `boost::dynamic_bitset` too) simply don't provide iterators at all.
Instead, `dynamic_bitset` provides `find_first` and `find_next`, and libstdc++'s `bitset`
provides secret `_Uglified` versions of the same methods.

Like a Python set, `bitset` provides overloaded `&`, `|`, `^`, `~` that perform intersection,
union, symmetric-difference, and invert operations. But then, as if the type author were free-associating
on the other meanings of those operators, it goes on to provide `<<` and `>>`. Which makes no sense at all
if you're thinking of `bitset` either as a sequence container of bits (like `vector<bool>`) or a set of
indices (as we were just doing in the previous paragraph), but perfect sense if you're thinking of
it as an integer type.

`std::bitset<N>` ends up behaving similarly to an integer type with `N` bits... except that it
can't do the full suite of arithmetic operations out of the box. You can still implement those operations
tediously by hand. (Thanks to Maciej Hehl [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4068918/1424877) for this code.
Note that adding operators to a type we don't own, such as `bitset`, is very ill-advised in practice;
we'd do better to name this function `plus`, or wrap the `bitset`s in a class of our own devising.)

    template<size_t N>
    auto operator+(const std::bitset<N>& a, const std::bitset<N>& b) {
        auto carry = a & b;
        auto result = a ^ b;
        while (carry.any()) {
            auto shifted = carry << 1;
            carry = result & shifted;
            result ^= shifted;
        }
        return result;
    }

## Conclusion

There's not much to conclude here, except that C++ currently has a bunch of ways
to do bit-strings, and none of them are particularly well crafted.
`vector<bool>` is iterable but not arithmetic'able; `bitset<N>` is arithmetic'able
but fails to be iterable or even resizable; different library vendors provide vastly
different performance profiles for STL algorithms on bit iterators.

Madhur and I produced a benchmark ([backup](/blog/code/2022-11-05-bitset-benchmark.cpp)) comparing all these different ways of
"find-next'ing" in a bit-string of a million elements. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/z1adndrY6)
are the results on libc++; you can see that libc++'s `std::find` is a huge winner.

[Here](https://godbolt.org/z/r95rnYMoG)
are the results on libstdc++; note that libstdc++'s `std::find` is a huge loser,
even compared to manual iteration:

    DynBitsetFindnext      47 ns      30 ns     29609779

These benchmark numbers were prooduced on VMs at godbolt.org, so they should be
taken with a grain of salt especially when comparing across the two benchmark
runs. But no amount of salt will erase a 100x speedup or slowdown.
