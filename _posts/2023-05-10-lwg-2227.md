Which of the Big Three C++ vendors wrote your standard library?
This code snippet will tell you ([Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/qsnsrEnfa)):

    struct C : std::less<> {
      std::shared_ptr<int> s_;
      explicit C(std::shared_ptr<int> s) : s_(s) {}
    };

    int main() {
      auto p = std::make_shared<int>(42);
      auto s = std::set<int, C>(C(p));
      auto t = std::move(s);
      t = std::move(s);

      const char *libraries[] = {
        "unknown",
        "libc++",
        "libstdc++",
        "Microsoft STL",
      };
      std::cout << libraries[p.use_count()] << '\n';
    }

That's because vendors disagree as to what should happen when you move-from
a `std::set`: should you move-from its comparator as well, or copy the comparator?
If you move-from the comparator, it'll be left in a moved-from state, which means
that the `set` is now radioactive ([Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/nMqeM5Y98)):

    using C = std::function<bool(int,int)>;
    std::set<int, C> s({1,2,3}, std::less());
    decltype(s) t;
    t = std::move(s);
      // leaves s.key_comp() in a moved-from state
    s.insert({1,2,3});
      // throws std::bad_function_call

The three vendors do three different things with `set`'s special members:

- libc++: Move in the move constructor; move in the move-assignment operator
- libstdc++: Copy in the move constructor (for historical reasons?); move in the move-assignment operator
- Microsoft: Copy in the move constructor; copy in the move-assignment operator

This is a particularly bad scene because the C++ standard actually [defines](https://eel.is/c++draft/set)
a noexcept-specification for `set::operator=` —

    set& operator=(set&& x)
      noexcept(allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value &&
               is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<Compare>);

So Microsoft's implementation will never enter a radioactive state,
but [will do](https://godbolt.org/z/aoK76TYEx) a "rogue `std::terminate`"
if copying the comparator throws. It's unclear if this behavior is conforming.

This area is the subject of [LWG issue 2227](https://wg21.link/lwg2227), which has been
open since 2012. I've been interested in it since 2019 — see my CppCon talk
["Mostly Invalid: flat_map, Exception Guarantees, and the STL"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9ZYM0d6htg) —
but it's back on my front burner this year because C++23 gives us `flat_set`, which has exactly
the same problems in this area as C++98 `set`. Will each vendor's `flat_set` choose to match the
behavior of their own `set`? Or will we see consistency among vendors' `flat_set` implementations,
at the cost of consistency between each vendor's `flat_set` and `set`?
