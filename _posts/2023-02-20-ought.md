Have you ever noticed how so many English past tenses end with _-ought_ or _-aught_?

|----|----|
| bought | buy |
| brought | bring |
| caught | catch |
| distraught | distract |
| fought | fight |
| fraught | freight |
| might | may |
| sought | seek |
| taught | teach |
| thought | think |
| wrought | work, wreak |

(Consider also that something can be _stretched_ until it is _straight_, _tightened_ until it is _taut_.)

The other day I was reading [Thomas Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edwards_(critic))'
[_The Canons of Criticism_](https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA111) (1758) — a mildly
entertaining but much too long attack on William Warburton's editions of Pope and Shakespeare —
and came across a new entry for my table. _Hamlet_, Act III, Scene I:

> ROSENCRANTZ:  
> Madam, it so fell out, that certain players  
> We <b>o'er-raught</b> on the way: of these we told him;  
> And there did seem in him a kind of joy  
> To hear of it [...]

Edwards describes _over-raught_ as (not a corruption of _over-rode_ but) "the regular past tense of _over-reach_."
Compare Spenser's [_Faerie Queene_](https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/content/faerie-queene-book-i-canto-7-1596):

> A monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen  
> He chose, which he had kept long time in darksome den [...]  
> His tayle was stretched out in wondrous length,  
> That to the house of heauenly gods it <b>raught</b>,  
> And with extorted pow'r and borrow'd strength,  
> The euer-burning lamps from thence it brought,  
> And prowdly threw to ground, as things of nought.

Wiktionary further tells me that _raught_ or _rought_ can also be the past tense of _reck_
(as in _reckon_, _reckless_). _Reck_ and _reach_ derive from different Proto-Indo-European roots,
but have converged to be more or less synonymous with _grasp_ ([_pace_ Robert Browning](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43745/andrea-del-sarto)).

In writing this post, I learned that _hight_ (more or less synonymous with _yclept_) is the present perfect
of [_hote_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hote): "I am _hight_ Lancelot" only because people tend to _hote_ me Lancelot, you know.

And then there's this, from _Punchinello_ magazine [<b>2</b>:27](https://books.google.com/books?id=63otAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA11) (October 1870),
bylined "Amos Keeter" (get it?):

> Sally Salter, she was a young teacher, who <b>taught</b>,  
> And her friend, Charley Church, was a preacher, who <b>praught</b>;  
> Though his enemies called him a screecher, who <b>scraught</b>.
>
> His heart, when he saw her, kept sinking, and sunk,  
> And his eye, meeting hers, began winking, and wunk;  
> While she, in her turn, fell to thinking, and thunk.

> For his love grew until to a mountain it grewed,
