Jorge Luis Borges, [_The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv_](https://archive.org/details/borgesreader00jorg/page/63)
(1934, tr. N. T. di Giovanni):

> The world we live in is a mistake, a clumsy parody. Mirrors and fatherhood,
> because they multiply and confirm the parody, are abominations.

Samuel Butler, [_Erewhon Revisited_](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.458513/page/n629)
(1901), chapter XXVIII:

> I wish some one would write a book about dreams and parthenogenesis, for that
> the two are part and parcel of the same story — a brood of folly without father
> bred — I cannot doubt.

Another connection between the Veiled Prophet and Samuel Butler: Both
are notably associated with _jihad_.
