In Jane Loudon's _The Mummy!: A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century_ (1827) — more on
that soon — one of the running gags is that due to the success of "universal
education," all the lower-class people speak in learned Latinate phrases, while the
average member of the upper class affects ([I, 3](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(Loudon)/Volume_1/Chapter_3))

So we get this exchange between the foreigner Hans and an English cottager
([III, 6](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(Loudon)/Volume_3/Chapter_6)):

> "I opine that you must be unreasonable to grumble, when you consider the delightful
> occasion it affords you of refreshing your olfactory nerves by partaking of a little
> of this odoriferous atmosphere."

> "My what nerves?" asked Hans.
>
> "Your olfactory nerves," replied the learned cottager, with a look of the greatest
> possible contempt: "that is, the nerves that line the membrane of the nasal organ.
> Every child knows that the nasal fossæ are formed to receive sensations, as by their
> depth and extent a larger surface is given to the pituitary membrane, and these soft
> sinuses, or cavities, are enabled to retain a greater mass of air loaded with
> odoriferous matter."
>
> Poor Hans stood aghast at this explanation, which he found something like that said
> to be given by [Dr. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson),
> when he called net-work a complicated concatenation of rectangular angles.

Now, _did_ Johnson (1709–1784) ever define "network" as "a complicated concatenation of rectangular angles"?
Well, not in his famous [_Dictionary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language) (1755):
there he [defined](https://books.google.com/books?id=jaFfxyHnR1IC&pg=PA25-IA1)

> <span class="headline">Ne'tting.</span> _n. s._
> A reticulated piece of work.
>
> <span class="headline">Ne'twork.</span> _n. s._ [_net_ and _work_.]
> Any thing reticulated or decussated, at equal distances, with interstices between the intersections.
>
> Nor any skill'd in workmanship emboss'd;  
> Nor any skill'd in loops of fing'ring fine;  
> Might in their diverse cunning ever dare,  
> With this so curious <b>network</b> to compare.  
> &emsp; [_Spenser._](https://books.google.com/books?id=yWKoudPfIHUC&pg=PA157)
>
> A large cavity in the [sinciput](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sinciput#English)
> was filled with ribbons, lace, and embroidery, wrought together in a curious piece of <b>network</b>.  
> &emsp; [_Addison's Spectator._](https://books.google.com/books?id=mGlkAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA389)

Now, it's true that this definition of "network" was seen as particularly ridiculous —
probably even during Johnson's lifetime, although I can't find that anybody put it into print
until three years after his death.
[Lord Monboddo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burnett,_Lord_Monboddo), in
_On the Origin and Progress of Language_ (1787),
[II, 6](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_of-the-origin-and-progre_burnet-james-lord-monb_1777_4/page/298/), writes:

> There is a definition of _Network_ in Johnson's dictionary, which has been shown me, and,
> I think, is a curiosity of the kind. "Nettwork," says he, "is Any thing reticulated or decussated
> at equal distances, with interstices between the intersections." This may not be a good definition
> of Network, but it is a very good description of the author; for nothing characterises a pedant
> more than the use of hard words, not intelligible except to a few, in describing a common thing.

James Boswell specifically mentions the definition of "network" (presumably subtweeting Monboddo)
in his [_Life of Johnson_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_of_Samuel_Johnson) (1791)
[thus](https://books.google.com/books?id=RPHN3AkG00cC&pg=PA97):

> His definition of _Network_ has been often quoted with sportive malignity,
> as obscuring a thing in itself very plain.

Notice that Boswell doesn't actually quote the definition! This seems to have created an audience who
knew _of_ Johnson's definition but didn't know _what_ it was; inviting spurious definitions
to arise. I don't know if Loudon invented her version or is quoting it from someone else.
We do find the same spurious definition quoted a half-century later in
[_The Ladies' Guide to Needle Work, Embroidery, Etc._](https://archive.org/details/ladiesguidetonee00shei/page/110/) (1877);
I'm willing to bet that that author read it in _The Mummy!_

> The method of teaching [netting] by explanation is not easy, nor would Dr. Johnson's

> a more simple explanation.

P.S. — The phrase "complicated concatenation" occurs surprisingly often in the corpus:
"the complicated concatenation of secondary causes" ([1787](https://archive.org/details/bim_eighteenth-century_the-history-of-the-turki_mignot-vincent_1787_2/page/256/)),
"[Job's] complicated concatenation of afflictions" ([1817](https://archive.org/details/sim_the-antijacobin-review-and-protestant-advocate_1817-06_52/page/392/)),
even in a modern translation of
[Borges'](https://www.literatura.us/borges/laotra.html) phrase "la intrincada concatenación de causas y efectos" (1949).
