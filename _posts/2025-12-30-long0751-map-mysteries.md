Way back in 2017, I [commented](https://bluerenga.blog/2017/08/08/adventure-501-outdoors/)
on Jason Dyer's blog re Dennis Donovan's beautifully detailed map of LONG0751:

At this point I can say confidently that I was wrong about some of that.
All of the following bits of Donovan's map are real and functional, not just decorative:
the drainage ditch (ravine), the cliff ledge above the vines, the giant centipede.
(His name is Ralph!) The flat bit in the marsh (with sign reading "Site of Proposed
Municipal Parking Lot"), while also real and functional, is *not* the helipad.

In fact, the helipad doesn't appear on this map at all. And — now that I know what to
look for — I also cannot find:

* The Lost Silver Mine.
* The Secret Garden.
* The Gnomes' Conservatory.
* The kitchen.
* The castle staircase: rather, I see stairs going *down*, rather than *up*.

Therefore, I infer that Dennis Donovan based his map on a version of LONG0751 that
(was already much bigger than LONG0501, but) didn't yet have these features.
Perhaps the "missing-link" version Donovan depicted was never actually released
on CompuServe: perhaps the game grew all those features (and its full 751 points)
before it reached anyone other than Long's GSB playtesters. I don't know.

Supposing that this "missing-link" version did exist for a little while, I see
some mysteries relating to that version and/or to Donovan's map.
Beware: these necessarily spoil parts of LONG0751.

* So in this version there's only one (super-difficult) way into the castle, right?
* Where is the flute on Donovan's map? It must be there somewhere, right?
    If not, then how—? (Spoiler redacted.)
* The candle is depicted at the Altar. This surprises me, because why would
    it be there already? This might even explode my entire "missing link"
    conjecture. (There's no candle in LONG0501.)
* What is the item depicted in the Great Hall? It looks like a little book
    with an "X" on the cover, face-down.

And I have new appreciation for some details that I wouldn't have noticed if
I weren't now looking specifically for them:

* The north passage from Tongue of Rock is depicted.
* The ravine is depicted but (rightly, I infer) the marble statue is not.
* The shamrock, shovel, and card are depicted.
* So is the rose, if you look closely.
* I *don't* see the cloth bag depicted, but I assume it's present.
* The Cloakroom is charming.
* The details at the Breathtaking View are painstakingly accurate!
* The lyre is clearly depicted as a lute. Oops.
