I've recently engaged in book-club discussions on the following
classic papers in the field of "artificial intelligence":

- Geoffrey Jefferson (1949), ["The Mind of Mechanical Man"](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2050428/pdf/brmedj03683-0003.pdf)
- Alan Turing (1950), ["Computing Machinery and Intelligence"](https://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf): introduced the "Imitation Game"
- Thomas Nagel (1974), ["What Is it Like to Be a Bat?"](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Nagel_Bat.pdf)
- John Searle (1980), ["Minds, Brains, and Programs"](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/searle.minds.brains.programs.bbs.1980.pdf): introduced the "Chinese Room"

Some notes.

## Turing and Jefferson

Turing's essay ([says Bernardo Gonçalves](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/20484/), and I think he's right)
was basically a response to Jefferson's essay (as well as to Douglas Hartree's [_Calculating Machines_](https://amzn.to/42RLjWP) (1947)
and to Turing's discussions with [Michael Polanyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi)). I highly recommend
Jefferson's essay. Not only did I find it extremely coherent and focused, but to know that Turing read it goes a long way
to explain some features of Turing's own essay: the focus on a non-mathematical "game,"
the suggestion of sonnet-writing, the otherwise tangential theme of sex difference. Jefferson:

> [N]either animals nor men can be explained by studying nervous mechanics in isolation,
> so complicated are they by endocrines, so coloured is thought by emotion. Sex hormones
> introduce peculiarities of behaviour often as inexplicable as they are impressive
> (as in migratory fish). We should not have any real idea how to make a model electronic
> salmon however simple relatively its nervous system is [...]

## Nagel and Searle

Nagel and Searle both base their conclusions more on intuition than on rigor.
Nagel claims, intuitively, that there are things humans can never know, such as what it
is _like_ to be a bat — that is, a bat's subjective experience, as opposed to merely
assenting to a list of objective propositions such as "A bat hunts by echolocation" which we might say
tell us what being a bat _is_, without giving us any whiff at all of what being a bat _is like_.

John Locke (1690), _An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_
[III.iv](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding/Book_III#Chapter_IV:_Of_the_Names_of_Simple_Ideas):

> Simple ideas [...] are only to be got by those impressions objects themselves make on our minds,
> by the proper inlets appointed to each sort. If they are not received this way, all the words in
> the world, made use of to explain or define any of their names, will never be able to produce in us
> the idea it stands for. [...]
>
> A studious blind man, who had mightily beat his head about visible objects, and made use of the explication
> of his books and friends, [...] bragged one day that he now understood what "scarlet" signified. Upon which,
> his friend demanding what scarlet was? the blind man answered, it was like the sound of a trumpet.
> Just such an understanding of the name of any other simple idea will he have
> who hopes to get it only from a definition, or other words made use of to explain it.

Searle claims, intuitively, that syntax is distinct from semantics. No amount of piling syntax upon syntax
will ever get you all the way to semantics. No formal algorithm, however lengthy, for transforming squiggles
into squoggles can ever be said itself to engage in the _understanding_ of the Chinese language. (As a computer
programmer, I'm very sympathetic with this view. We often "express" a semantic idea by inventing new syntax
for it, and telling people to use that syntax whenever they mean to express the semantic. But the compiler
itself doesn't understand the _semantics_, or at least does not get those semantics from your code; it's
merely reacting to the _syntax_ of your code.)

Searle considers an "English room," containing a person such as himself, who receives questions written
on slips of paper through one slot and writes out answers through another slot. In the English room system,
an "understanding" of English (the subjective experience of _what it is like to be_ an English speaker)
clearly resides in the occupant of the room. Then, Searle considers a similar "Chinese room," containing a person
such as himself who does not understand Chinese, but has access to a formal algorithm (expressed as a gigantic
book of instructions, say) by which the uncomprehended squiggles on each input slip of paper are mapped
to another set of uncomprehended squoggles on an output slip. In the Chinese room system, it seems there
is nowhere for an "understanding" of the Chinese language to hide: it's certainly not in the occupant,
and intuitively it seems impossible for "understanding" (that is, the subjective experience of
_what it is like to be_ a Chinese speaker) to reside in an inanimate instruction-book, however gigantic.

The obvious rebuttal (which Searle acknowledges, rather dismissively, under the name "the systems reply")
is that there must indeed _be_ "understanding" taking place in the whole Chinese room system itself (man,
book, slots, and all). That the human occupant doesn't partake in the subjective experience of speaking
Chinese is no more surprising than that my own tongue, say, fails to partake in my own subjective
experience of speaking English.

Now, suppose we disagree with Searle and agree that the Chinese room (or a formal algorithm in general)
_can_ have the same kinds of subjective experiences as a human. Well, says Nagel, surely a computer
couldn't have the same kinds of subjective experiences as a bat! Which seems a bit like a
_reductio ad absurdum_, doesn't it? ...Or perhaps it's totally unsurprising that a computer _cannot_
tell us what it's like to be a bat, _cannot_ tell us what it's like to be a human —
but perhaps a computer _could_ tell us what it's like to be a computer.

Wittgenstein (1949-ish), [_Philosophical Investigations_](https://archive.org/details/philosophicalinvestigations_20191119/page/n228/):
"[If a lion could speak, we could not understand him.](https://existentialcomics.com/comic/245)"

## Like

Can a computer be conscious? Nagel equates consciousness with subjective experience:
"fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something
that it is like to _be_ that organism." As above: not a simple definition of what it is to be
that organism, but something that it is _like_ to be it.

Turing offers that a computer that can pass the imitation game ought to be able to feel enjoyment.
"[The claimed inability of any machine] to enjoy strawberries and cream may have struck the
reader as frivolous. [...] What is important about this disability is that it contributes
to some of the other disabilities, e.g., to the difficulty of the same kind of friendliness
occurring between man and machine as between white man and white man, or between black man and black man."
(In these enlightened times we might say "between man and man, or between bat and bat.")
That is, one important criterion for a Turing-style thinking machine is that it be able to _like_ things.

We might say: "Machines like people like people."

Douglas Hofstadter, of course, has written volumes and volumes on his ideas about computer
(and other) intelligence; to him the paramount quality of human-type intelligence is
what [he has called](https://archive.org/details/gdelescherbachan00hofs/page/619)
"analogical awareness."
[Hofstadter](https://archive.org/details/letonbeaudemarot00hofs/page/83) quotes
[Heinz Pagels](https://archive.org/details/dreamsofreasonth00page/page/94/) quoting Stanisław Ulam:

> What is it that you see when you see? You see an object _as_ a key,
> you see a man in a car _as_ a passenger, you see some sheets of paper _as_ a book.
> It is the word "as" that must be mathematically formalized ...
> Until you do that, you will not get very far with your AI problem.

Hofstader's [Fluid Analogies Research Group](https://wayback.archive-it.org/219/20220524135752/https://cogsci.indiana.edu/research.html)
has worked on analogical reasoning in such guises as Bongard problems and
the [Copycat](https://github.com/Quuxplusone/co.py.cat) program; see Hofstadter's
[_Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies_](https://amzn.to/3EIlCOg) (1996).
More recently, the "ARC-AGI Prize" evaluates LLMs on their ability to
solve [analogy-based pictorial tasks](https://web.archive.org/web/20250101001433/https://arcprize.org/guide#data-structure);
for examples of such tasks see section 3 of ["On the Measure of Intelligence"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01547) (François Chollet, 2019).

That is, Hofstadter's prime criterion for a thinking machine is that it intuit
how one thing is _like_ another.

It is probably an utterly meaningless coincidence that the same English word appears
in all three of these thinkers' criteria for a "thinking machine" —
that there is something it is _like_ to be it, that it can actually _like_ something,
that it can see one thing is _like_ another. These criteria seem disjointed — unrelated —
maybe because the concept of a "thinking machine" itself is vague and nebulous.
And it is most likely coincidental that when we must speak about the nebulous,
we often speak vaguely and disjointedly — falling back on one utterly meaningless
interjection in particular — and we're like, _“Like...”_
