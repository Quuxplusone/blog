The other day I read Jorge Luis Borges' short story
"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" (1940) for the first time.

> The nations of [Tlön's southern hemisphere] are congenitally idealist.
> Their language and the derivations of their language - religion,
> letters, metaphysics - all presuppose idealism. The world for them
> is not a concourse of objects in space; it is a heterogeneous series
> of independent acts. It is successive and temporal, not spatial.
> There are no nouns in Tlön's conjectural _Ursprache_, from which
> the "present" languages and the dialects are derived: there are
> impersonal verbs, modified by monosyllabic suffixes (or prefixes)
> with an adverbial value. For example: there is no word corresponding
> to the word "moon," but there is a verb which in English would be
> "to moon" or "to moonate."

Compare to Steve Yegge's [Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)
(March 2006). I admit I find it impossible to imagine a grammar
in which nouns _really_ don't exist at all; but I wonder if it's
particularly hard for English-speakers, English being a language
in which [verbing](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/01/25)
(or vice versa, nouning) is particularly inescapable.

Meanwhile, Tlön's extreme anti-materialism — the perception of the world
as a series of unconnected phenomena, rather than as temporal slices of
some underlying material reality — leads to some interesting literary
conventions.

> Works of fiction contain a single plot, with all its imaginable permutations.
> [...] A book which does not contain its counterbook is considered incomplete.

And:

> The concept of plagiarism does not exist: it has been established that
> all works are the creation of one author, who is atemporal and anonymous.
> The critics often invent authors: they select two dissimilar works —
> the Tao Te Ching and the 1001 Nights, say —; attribute them to the
> same writer; and then determine most scrupulously the psychology
> of this interesting _homme de lettres_.

This serendipitously reminded me of Carl Jung's [_Answer to Job_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Job) (1952);
not only is Jung concerned with achieving "completeness" through the integration
of opposites, but he bases much of _Job_'s thesis on the psychoanalysis of an
essentially accidental character: a conflation of
the loving [John of the Epistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannine_epistles)
with the vengeful [John of Revelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Patmos).
Jung writes:

> I have seen many compensating dreams of believing Christians who deceived
> themselves about their real psychic constitution and imagined that they were in a
> different condition from what they were in reality. But I have seen nothing that
> even remotely resembles the brutal impact with which the opposites collide in
> John's visions, except in the case of severe psychosis.

Anyway, the translation of "Tlön, Uqbar" I found was
[James E. Irby's](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-Tl%C3%B6n-Uqbar-Orbius-Tertius.pdf) (1961).
In the process of looking up Irby's full name for this post, I came across
["Dear Mr. Borges, Which Translation Should I Read?"](https://medium.com/@michael.marcus/c132acf994ac)
(Michael Marcus, December 2018), in which it is alleged that Borges himself viewed
the process of translation between languages almost as a translation between media —
Spanish and English as different as stage and screen.

> In the preface to [_The Aleph and Other Stories_](https://amzn.to/3RfNGcy), Borges writes:
> "Working closely together in daily sessions, we have tried to make
> these stories read as though they had been written in English. We do not
> consider English and Spanish as compounded sets of easily interchangeable
> synonyms; they are two quite different ways of looking at the world,
> each with a nature of its own. [...]"
>
> To Borges, a translation [could] become something just as compelling as it was
> in its original language, perhaps even in new and slightly different ways.

This serendipitously recalls what Leonard Leff says on the commentary track
of [the Criterion Collection's DVD](https://amzn.to/3SrrPAx) of _Rebecca_
(also, coincidentally, 1940):
that Alfred Hitchcock always viewed his source material with a great deal of
"ruthlessness." In _Film Weekly_ (May 1936)
[Hitchcock wrote:](https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/Film_Weekly_(1936)_-_My_Screen_Memories)

> I believe that I owe much of the success I have been lucky enough to achieve to my
> "ruthlessness" in adapting stories for the screen.
>
> A book may have the germ of a screen idea in it. This germ may be in the plot;
> it may be in the characters; it may be in the background; or it may be in certain
> of the situations. But that does not mean that the book itself would make a good film.
>
> I have always maintained that it is supreme foolishness to take any book and film the
> whole of it just because one angle of it is really worth screening. There can be no
> doubt that _The 39 Steps_ is a rattling good book, but I couldn't see it as good
> film material.
>
> I found that by taking certain of the characters, part of the plot, and the excellent locales,
> I had the background for a very good screen story. Therefore I ignored the book as it stood,
> and developed the story with the screen in mind.
>
> This I always do, and always have done. I never soak myself in a book before starting to adapt it.
> In fact, before now, I have written a scenario without even completely reading the original book,

>
> A good original screen plot is very, very hard to find. But if you can see an idea in a published book,
> why shouldn't it be developed? It is far fairer to acknowledge the source and pay the original author

> known this to happen in filmland).

Contrast with Roman Polanski's film of _Rosemary's Baby_, where it's quite possible
Polanski didn't know he was allowed to change anything. (Previously on this blog:
["Transcription of _All of Them Witches_"](/blog/2019/08/26/rosemarys-baby-book/) (2019-08-26).)
