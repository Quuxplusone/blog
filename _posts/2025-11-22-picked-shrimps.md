This afternoon I presented a paper at the quarterly meeting of the “Three Garridebs,”
Westchester’s scion society of the Baker Street Irregulars. Here it is for
posterity, almost entirely as delivered (minus a brief ad-lib apology for its being
more about Miss Marple than about Sherlock Holmes).

----

At the beginning of Watson’s 1904 story _The Missing Three-Quarter_, Sherlock Holmes
remarks that “even the most _insignificant_ problem would be welcome in these stagnant days.”
However, in _A Case of Identity_, published 1891, Holmes had indicated that in fact
“it is usually in <i>un</i>-important matters that there is a field for the
observation and quick analysis of cause and effect which give charm to an investigation.
The _larger_ crimes are apt to be the simpler”; by which he means the _little_ mysteries
are apt to be the more baffling.

About forty years later, Agatha Christie published _The Thirteen Problems_, a collection of
stories about Miss Jane Marple, resident mystery-solver of St. Mary Mead. These stories are
grouped in two sixes: six stories told at a dinner-party one year, and six at a party
the next year. In the book's first story, titled _The Tuesday Night Club_,
in the presence of guests including Sir Henry Clithering (erstwhile Commissioner of Scotland Yard),
Miss Marple's nephew Raymond West asks these guests for contributions on the subject of
“unsolved mysteries: things that have happened and that no one has ever explained.”

> “I know just the sort of thing you mean, dear,” said Miss Marple. “For
> instance Mrs. Carruthers had a very strange experience yesterday morning. She
> bought two gills of picked shrimps at Elliot’s. She called at two other shops and
> when she got home she found she had not got the shrimps with her. She went
> back to the two shops she had visited, but these shrimps had completely
> disappeared. Now that seems to me very remarkable.”
>
> “A very fishy story,” said Sir Henry, gravely.
>
> “There are, of course, all kinds of possible explanations,” said Miss Marple.
> “For instance—”

but Raymond cuts her off, and the story of Mrs. Carruthers is not again referred to—<i>that</i> year.
What Mrs. Carruthers had lost, by the way, was two gills, or half a pint; of “picked shrimps,”
or shrimp-meat without the shells in, such as one might use in hors d’oeuvres
or sauces.

Now, the book’s tenth story, _A Christmas Tragedy_, takes place
about a year later. Sir Henry visits again, and, like Watson in _A Case of Identity_,
asks Miss Marple whether she has currently any “pet mystery” to report.

> Miss Marple shook her head.
> “Nothing that would interest you, Sir Henry. We have our _little_ mysteries, of
> course—there was that gill of picked shrimps that disappeared so
> incomprehensibly; but that wouldn’t interest you because it all turned out to be
> so trivial, though throwing a considerable light on human nature.”

Sir Henry encourages her to tell the story; but “You’re so fond of your joke,”
says Miss Marple. “The shrimps are only nonsense.”

So it is clear that sometime in the intervening year Miss Marple
has solved the mystery of the missing shrimps.
_The Murder at the Vicarage_, published 1930, at first seems to confirm this.
When Colonel Protheroe is murdered, the vicar’s wife, Griselda, says:

> “I wish you’d solve the case, Miss Marple, like you did the way Miss Wetherby’s
> gill of picked shrimps disappeared. And all because it reminded you of something
> quite different about a sack of coals.”
>
> “You’re laughing, my dear,” said Miss Marple. “But, after all, that is a very
> sound way of arriving at the truth.”

The vicar adds: “You mean that if a thing reminds you of something
else—well, it’s probably the same kind of thing.”

Later, Miss Marple herself mentions having solved the mystery:

> “Take a _little_ problem—for instance the gill of picked shrimps that amused
> dear Griselda so much—a quite unimportant mystery, but absolutely incomprehensible
> unless one solves it right.”

This raises the question: What _was_ Miss Marple’s solution to the
incomprehensible affair of the shrimps?

Now, the alert listener will have noticed a subtle evolution: In _The Tuesday Night Club_,
the mystery was that Mrs. _Carruthers_ had lost _two_
gills of shrimps. In _A Christmas Tragedy_, it was the incomprehensible
disappearance of _one_ gill. And in _Murder at the Vicarage_, it’s
Miss _Wetherby_ who has lost it. Not only does Christie
withhold the answer to this mundane mystery, it’s unclear what the question is!

This puzzle caught my eye [on the question-and-answer website StackExchange](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/25818/what-happened-to-the-gills-of-picked-shrimps),
and I decided to dig into it. In my researches I did turn up one novel solution
to a shrimp mystery.
In [_Notes and Queries_, November 21, 1891](https://archive.org/details/s7notesqueries12londuoft/page/410), a correspondent writes:

> Ideas as to what is “good for food” come simply from use and habit.
> I remember, about thirty years ago, when the “harvest of the sea” did not often
> come far inland, my father, who was staying at Weymouth, sent some shrimps to
> the parish clerk at home in Warwickshire. But afterwards, on being asked how
> they were enjoyed, the old clerk bashfully owned that “they looked so like
> crickets that none of the family could bring themselves to eat them, so
> they were buried in the garden.”

Still, I doubt that’s the correct solution to _our_ case.

----

During the Second World War, Agatha Christie wrote a Miss Marple novel
and sealed it, unpublished, in a bank vault, as a kind of pension plan for her daughter.
That novel was published posthumously in 1976 under the title _Sleeping Murder_.
In chapter three, Raymond West is speaking of his Aunt Jane.
“She adores problems,” he says;

> “any kind of problems. What happened to the vicar’s surplice.
> Why the grocer’s wife took her umbrella to the church social on a fine evening.
> Why a gill of picked shrimps was found where it was. All grist to my Aunt
> Jane’s mill.”

Why a gill of shrimps was _found_ where it was!

I find it marvelous that Christie seems to have spent a half-century, some of it
posthumously, doling out these clues in precisely the proper order. The meta-mystery
at first is: how does Mrs. Carruthers’ two-gill loss relate to a one-gill loss?
Then we learn the one-gill loss was suffered by someone else entirely.
Finally, learning that one gill was also _found_ in an unexpected place
alters the whole case, and makes it comprehensible!

----

Now here’s my solution. Here’s what I think happened:

Mrs. Carruthers goes to Elliot’s in the morning and buys two gills of shrimps.
She then visits shops A and B. At one of these she absent-mindedly leaves her shrimps behind
on a shelf. She discovers her loss and retraces her steps to shops A and B,
but neither shopkeeper has seen her shrimps. Perhaps they were thrown out by the morning assistant.

That afternoon, Miss Wetherby _also_ goes to Elliot’s, and
buys a _single_ gill of picked shrimps. Miss Wetherby _also_ absent-mindedly
leaves them somewhere—let’s say in shop C.

Mrs. Carruthers tells Miss Marple about the disappearance of her
two gills of shrimps. The next evening, Miss Marple tells Sir Henry and the others.
This is critical to the development of the mystery, because it allows word
to get around; so that the next day, when Mrs. Carruthers enters shop C, Shopkeeper C
tells her, “I found those shrimps that you lost the other day!” Mrs. Carruthers is
mystified as to how this could be, as she had not visited shop C until
_after_ she’d lost her shrimps.

Later, of course, Miss Marple hears not only about this find
but also about Miss Wetherby’s loss, and puts two and two together.

During _The Tuesday Night Club_, while events are still unfolding,
the mystery is what became of Mrs. Carruthers’ shrimps.
The next afternoon, the mystery is how Mrs. Carruthers’ shrimps could possibly
have been found in shop C, when she had visited only shops A and B.
Some time between _The Tuesday Night Club_ and _A Christmas Tragedy_,
a third mystery is added: what became of Miss Wetherby’s gill of shrimps.
Only Miss Marple has enough information to tie all three mysteries together.
“A quite unimportant mystery,
but absolutely incomprehensible unless one solves it right.”
