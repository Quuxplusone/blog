My wife and I just last month finished bingeing _Succession_ (HBO, 2018–2023).
One of the fun things about _Succession_ is its little throwaway gags in
the form of news chyrons on ATN, the Roy family's Fox-alike news channel.
Here's all the joke chyrons I've noticed. If I missed one, please alert me
and I'll add it!

> Note on notation: HBO Max makes it hard to get a reliable timestamp from
> the beginning of the episode, what with the ads and promos and HBO splash screen
> and the playback bar that shows only time left, not time elapsed. For example,
> HBO Max lists S1E1 at 64:20 total running time, but that counts an ad for AMC+
> at the beginning and a two-minute "Inside the Episode" promo at the end.
> The HBO splash screen shows up at −63:44; the _Succession_
> opening credits start at −60:50. The first chyron appears at −60:12. I'll record
> that as "<span title="S1E1−60:12">S1E1+00:38</span>," measured from the start
> of the opening credits; but if you mouse over that span you'll see "S1E1−60:12"
> conveniently indicating the time left in the streaming episode according to the
> HBO Max playback bar as of September 2023. The former should be pretty robust
> even if the latter rots.

> Note on content: Some background chyrons are non-joke news, such as
> <span title="S1E4−60:41">S1E4+2:10</span> <span class="headline">Extended hurricane season threatens holiday travel</span>;
> others are plot-relevant but still not jokes, such as
> <span title="S1E7−59:35">S1E7−2:29</span> <span class="headline">Logan Roy attacked with urine balloon</span>.
> I'm taking a strict "just the jokes, ma'am" policy here.

Bits in <span class="headline">[brackets]</span> are guesses that seem safe to me;
when I really can't make out a key word I'll use <span class="headline">[???]</span> and
when part of the text is off-screen entirely I'll use <span class="headline">[...]</span>.

## Season 1

Opening credits:

- <span title="S1E1−60:12">S1E1+00:38</span> <span class="headline">Why are so many of our older celebrities dying?</span>

The subchyron reads <span class="headline">Plans to fund national park renovations announced by USDA health recall on eggs in over 2mil stores</span>,
which seems to be a newsroom mixup of the non-joke headlines seen 8 seconds later —
<span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Waystar parks division expanding</span>
and (on the building ticker) <span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Massive eggs recall hits over 2 mil stores</span>.

- <span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Illegal immigrant accused of dressing as neighbor and stealing her job</span>
    (also <span title="S1E4−41:16">S1E4+19:26</span> with the spelling <span class="headline">neighbour</span>)

PGN gets in on the action during Shiv's chat with Gerri:

- <span title="S2E4−46:28">S2E4+12:24</span> <span class="headline">Secretary of Education "can't count" says unnamed aide</span>

- <span title="S3E3−23:18">S3E3+34:08</span> <span class="headline">Hollywood could soon 'sue the rest [...]</span>

The subchyrons on this next one look like real winners, but sadly aren't fully visible.

## Season 4

Opening credits:

- <span title="S4E1−66:30">S4E1+0:20</span> <span class="headline">China hack could see 40M Americans entombed in their electric cars</span>
- <span title="S4E1−66:30">S4E1+0:20</span> <span class="headline">Men's rights group wins battle to show sad elephant rhino porn</span>

Right after the first batch of opening-credits headlines, there's a _really_ quick flash of a digital ticker
reading <span title="S4E1−66:28">S4E1+0:22</span> <span class="headline">Ivy league college bans Eve [...]</span>.
The next word isn't visible; it might be "Ensler," "Online," or anything in between.

At the start of S4E2, we get more PGN chyrons:

- <span title="S4E2−63:46">S4E2−2:05</span> <span class="headline">[...] Garments in High School Sports</span>
- <span title="S4E2−63:06">S4E2−1:25</span> <span class="headline">FDA: "Bathing in Palm Oil Not Advised"</span>
- <span title="S4E2−63:00">S4E2−1:19</span> <span class="headline">Dems Attack Shaw Family Investments in Saudi Arabia</span>

This last one suggests a chyron subplot that I've been unable to figure out.
It might relate to a fictional version of real-life Canadian cable tycoon [J.R. Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.R._Shaw),
who died in 2020 and whose Shaw Communications was acquired by Rogers Communications in a [_Succession_-esque comedy of errors](https://archive.ph/8JlVd)
(2021–2023). The other chyron in this subplot is only partly visible as Logan surprises Hugo
at <span title="S4E2−47:19">S4E2+14:22</span>: <span class="headline">Amanda Shaw [...] work full-time [...]</span>.

- <span title="S4E2−50:22">S4E2+11:19</span> <span class="headline">Report: Illegal immigrants used as consultants by border patrol</span>
- <span title="S4E2−47:05">S4E2+14:36</span> <span class="headline">Michelin-star chef opens community soup kitchen supplied by roof garden</span>
- <span title="S4E2−47:05">S4E2+14:36</span> <span class="headline">Concerns raised over new "growin' kid" booster seat range</span>
- <span title="S4E2−46:45">S4E2+14:56</span> <span class="headline">Ivy league school considering intimacy coordinators for first dates</span>
- <span title="S4E2−46:24">S4E2+15:17</span> <span class="headline">PETA claims Halloween costume competition for dogs is 'cruel'</span>
- <span title="S4E2−22:41">S4E2+39:00</span> <span class="headline">[???] plan for post-election [???] of all sexually active males</span>

In S4E4, we get a whole stack of fictional newspapers: first the "_NY Globe_" (a _Post_ lookalike) with
cover lines

- <span title="S4E4−45:28">S4E4+16:53</span> <span class="headline">Logan Gets the Last Laugh: Dems fume as world pays tribute</span>
- <span title="S4E4−45:28">S4E4+16:53</span> <span class="headline">‘Generous with your taxes, selfish in the sack’: Jiménez ex tells all</span>
- <span title="S4E4−45:28">S4E4+16:53</span> <span class="headline">Cannabis café franchise strikes gold</span>

and then at <span title="S4E4−44:18">S4E4+18:03</span>
"_The Correspondent_," which isn't [_De Correspondent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Correspondent) but
does have a Dutch flag in its nameplate. The _Correspondent_'s top stories besides "Media visionary Logan Roy dies"
are "Germany hit by extreme floods" (dating Logan's death to July/August 2021) and "U.S. Supreme Court strikes down Maryland free-speech legislation"
(dating it to an alternate-universe May 2022 in which SCOTUS decided to hear
[_Clear Channel v Baltimore_](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-219.html) after all).

We see the _Globe_ again in S4E8, with these cover lines:

- <span title="S4E8−50:15">S4E8+18:30</span> <span class="headline">Jime<i>nyet!</i> Republicans say vote 'no' to Dems to avoid Soviet-Era/Socialist state</span>
- <span title="S4E8−50:15">S4E8+18:30</span> <span class="headline">Galactic Jet-Setting: How Silicon Valley plans to make Mars "VIP Earth"</span>

The series ends with a whimper, chyron-wise, as the last few episodes grow increasingly
more serious. Some of the chyrons are cynically amusing in context, but none are jokes _per se._ Selected examples:

- <span title="S4E8−36:30">S4E8+32:15</span> <span class="headline">Ravenhead: We should count the real votes, not rely on elite politicos</span>
- <span title="S4E8−6:56">S4E8+61:49</span> (PGN) <span class="headline">DNC accuses ATN head Tom Wambsgans of undermining democracy</span>
- <span title="S4E9−75:45">S4E9+3:12</span> <span class="headline">Pres-elect Mencken: Appointments will be held to 'highest ethical standards in history'</span>
- <span title="S4E9−69:36">S4E9+9:21</span> <span class="headline">Mencken blasts Wisconsin revote debate as 'unAmerican'</span>


## Non-headlines

Go to the trouble of freeze-framing all these chyrons and you'll catch other remarkably trivial tidbits, such as:

- <span title="S1E7−57:55">S1E7−0:48</span>, a phony [_New York_](https://nymag.com/) magazine with cover lines that seem spot-on
    to this _New York_ reader: "The Traffic Problem: It's Not Going to Get Better,"
    "How Pantone Picks the Color of the Year," "The Best Ethiopian Restaurants," "People Who Love Small Things,"
    "Leave Streaming and Go Back to Cable," "Who Doesn't Love a Parade?"
- <span title="S2E8−61:29">S2E8+1:34</span>, the tag line for Willa's play _Sands_:
    "One woman's harrowing confinement in a land ruled by a mad king and escape into total expression."
- <span title="S3E1−43:57">S3E1+12:53</span>, a typo at the Croatian airport: "Wi-Fi Zranca_Luka_FREE"
    (_airport_ in Croatian being _zračna luka_, not _zranca_).
- <span title="S3E3−11:26">S3E3+46:00</span>, all the quotes on ATN's motivational video cart:
    "Women are completely supported by men in the newsroom and vice versa" —Avery Baker, Writer, Rise & Shine America.
    "As a strong woman, I don't come to work to feel comfortable. I come to work to be challenged." —Tanya Yarmak, Senior Vice President, Gourmando.
- <span title="S3E5−64:05">S3E5−1:53</span>, the check-in iPad at the shareholders' meeting involving
    a completely unsorted list of names
- <span title="S3E8−26:52">S3E8+38:16</span>, another typo in a CNCEB subchyron:
    <span class="headline">Cyrpto currency app gains 1 million sign-ups on launch day</span>
- <span title="S4E5−20:00">S4E5+41:03</span>, in the rough cut of _Kalispitron: Hibernation_ ("Property of Waystar Studios - Do Not Duplicate"):
    a placeholder textbox reading "Insert Kalispitron Hand Holding Car"
