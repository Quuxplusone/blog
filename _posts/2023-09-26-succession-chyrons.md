My wife and I just finished bingeing _Succession_ (HBO, 2018–2023) last month.
One of the fun bits about _Succession_ is the background throwaway gags in the
form of news chyrons on ATN, the Roy family's Fox-alike news channel.
Here's all the joke chyrons I've noticed. If I missed one, please alert me
and I'll add it!

> Note on notation: HBO Max makes it hard to get a reliable timestamp from
> the beginning of the episode, what with the ads and promos and HBO splash screen
> and the playback bar that shows only time left, not time elapsed. For example,
> HBO Max lists S1E1 at 64:20 total running time, but that counts an ad for AMC+,
> a "stay tuned after the episode" screen, and a two-minute "Inside the Episode"
> promo at the end. The HBO splash screen shows up at −63:44; the _Succession_
> opening credits start at −60:50. The first chyron appears at −60:12; I'll record
> that as "<span title="S1E1−60:12">S1E1+00:38</span>," measured from the start
> of the opening credits; but if you mouse over that span you'll see "S1E1−60:12"
> conveniently indicating the time left in the streaming episode according to the
> HBO Max playback bar as of September 2023. The former should be pretty robust
> even if the latter rots.

> Note on content: Some background chyrons are non-joke news, such as
> <span title="S1E4−60:41">S1E4+1:50</span> <span class="headline">Extended hurricane season threatens holiday travel</span>;
> others are plot-relevant but still not jokes, such as
> <span title="S1E7−59:35">S1E7−2:29</span> <span class="headline">Logan Roy attacked with urine balloon</span>.
> I'm taking a strict "just the joke ones, ma'am" policy here.

## Season 1

In the credits, we have:

- <span title="S1E1−60:12">S1E1+00:38</span> <span class="headline">Why are so many of our older celebrities dying?</span>

The subchyron reads <span class="headline">Plans to fund national park renovations announced by USDA health recall on eggs in over 2mil stores</span>,
which seems to be a newsroom mixup of the non-joke headlines seen 8 seconds later —
<span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Waystar parks division expanding</span>
and <span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Massive eggs recall hits over 2 mil stores</span>.

- <span title="S1E1−60:04">S1E1+00:46</span> <span class="headline">Illegal immigrant accused of dressing as neighbor and stealing her job</span>
    (also <span title="S1E4−XXXX">S1E4+XXXX</span>)

S1E2 is a gold mine of _Vaulter_ clickbait:

- <span title="S1E2−26:34">S1E2+32:59</span> <span class="headline">Soylent Green Could Become a Delicious Reality</span>
    (also <span title="S2E2−51:03">S2E2+XXXX</span>)
- <span title="S1E2−26:34">S1E2+32:59</span> <span class="headline">We Gave Krokodil to a Crocodile and Played It EDM</span>
- <span title="S1E2−26:34">S1E2+32:59</span> <span class="headline">Is the Art World the Solution to the Garbage Crisis?</span>

S1E3:

- <span title="S1E3+XXXX">S1E3+XXXX</span> <span class="headline">...pop star wanted for questioning in connection to Paris bank robbery</span>
    (also <span title="S1E7+XXXX">S1E7+XXXX</span>, <span title="S2E2+XXXX">S2E2+XXXX</span>
