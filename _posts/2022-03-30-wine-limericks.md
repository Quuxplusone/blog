Last month I and some family members entered the
Larson Family Winery's annual St. Patrick's Day
[limerick contest](https://www.larsonfamilywinery.com/press-release-larson-limerick-contest-2022/).
Here are our also-rans (the first by my mom, the others by me):

> My son, who really knows wine,  
> Proclaims that Larson's is fine.  
> He told me today,  
> "You may try the rosé —  
> "But the Gewürztraminer is mine!"

> Operations at one Napa winery  
> Share space with an oil refinery.  
> There's always the peril  
> Of mixing up barrels;  
> But that would mean someone's resignery.

> The limerick contest at Larson  
> Gave first prize this season to our son.  
> His key to success?  
> He says, "Well, I guess  
> The other guy entered a warse ’un."

In actual fact none of us won first prize, but the following
limerick got an honorable mention in the
[press release](https://www.sonomanews.com/article/entertainment/larson-family-winerys-annual-limerick-contest/)
([archive](https://archive.ph/PkaXk)):

> A winery owner that we know  
> Says he's quitting the biz (i.e., _vino_).  
> It's not that he minds  
> Tending the vines;  
> He's just tired of working for pinot!
