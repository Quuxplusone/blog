excerpt: |
  In ["Polycube snakes and ouroboroi"](/blog/2022/11/18/polycube-snakes/) (2022-11-18), I quoted Martin Gardner (June 1981) on the topic of
  filling space with polycube snakes:

  > We now ask a deceptively simple question. What is the smallest number of snakes needed to fill all space?
  > We can put it another way: Imagine space to be completely packed with an infinite number of unit cubes.
  > What is the smallest number of snakes into which it can be dissected by cutting along the planes that define
  > the cubes?
  >
  > [... Scott] Kim has found a way of twisting four infinitely long one-ended snakes into a structure of interlocked
  > helical shapes that fill all space. The method is too complicated to explain in a limited space; you will
  > have to take my word that it can be done. [...] Kim has conjectured that in a space of $$n$$ dimensions the
  > minimum number of snakes that completely fill it is $$2(n-1)$$, but the guess is still a shaky one.

  Back in March, I contacted Scott Kim through the Gathering 4 Gardner meetup and asked
  if he recalled his solution. Of course he did!

Back in March, I contacted Scott Kim through the Gathering 4 Gardner meetup and asked
if he recalled his solution. Of course he did! Scott quickly put together a diagram
([here](https://assets.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:US:98cb612d-b76a-43fd-9a71-0257ad38083f))
and presented his solution at a subsequent meetup ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-I_1WVkyfVQ&t=4198s)).

I made a Lego version of Scott's solution.
Shown fully disassembled (with bonus Welsh-terrier blur); partly assembled; and completely assembled.

That completely resolves my original desire to learn Scott Kim's four-snake space-filling pattern.
The original open problems remain:

- Can you fill space with only _three_ snakes?

- Can you fill 4-space with six polyhypercube snakes, 5-space with eight snakes, and so on?
