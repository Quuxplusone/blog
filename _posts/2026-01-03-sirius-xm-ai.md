At the end of 2025 I got the usual thing in the mail
saying that my Sirius XM car-radio subscription was going
to renew and replace my current promotional price ($107.88/year)
with the standard monthly price ($24.98/month). So, as usual
every year, I called Sirius to get the promotional price back.

This procedure is fairly mechanical and foolproof. However,
in my experience it always involved at least a little bit of
social performance: "I don't understand! You're going to charge
me _more_ this year? How can this be? Can't I just get the old
price back?" And sometimes you end up with a promotional trial
of yet _another_ feature: "well, since you're already on Plan A,
I'm not allowed to give you the promotional price for A; but if
you upgrade to A plus B, then I can give you the original
promotional price for both A and B together."

So yesterday I called Sirius's billing line... and I got the
voice of an AI assistant! After some preliminaries establishing
my account — even before I'd had a chance to explain my "problem" —
the AI volunteered cheerily: "I have a great deal for you!
If you renew today, I can give you the same plan you have today
for the promotional price of $7.99 per month all in." (Some AIs
love "both—and—"; Sirius XM's AI loved the phrase "all in.")
"Would you like to take advantage of this offer?" Yes, I would.
The AI read me the terms and conditions, which as usual included
that the price would go back to "an estimated $24.98 per month"
at the end of the promotional term. "Do I have your consent to
accept the terms and conditions of this offer and charge your
credit card now?"

At this point I thought to ask the AI: "$7.99 is okay,
but can we do better? Could we do $6.99?"

"Sure thing!" it said (or words to that effect). It read me
the terms and conditions for a $6.99/month ($83.88/year)
promotional price. "Do I have your consent to accept the terms
and conditions of this offer and charge your credit card now?"

Yes, I said, feeling like I'd gotten away with something.
We ended the call and I got email confirmation of my new $6.99/month
plan. Immediately I felt some regret that I hadn't kept pushing;
would the AI have given me a $4.99/month plan? A $1.99/month plan?
A completely free plan? (After all, as I understand it, Sirius
is a broadcast over-the-air technology, like radio; unlike gas/electric,
even unlike cable, the marginal cost of a customer to Sirius
is literally zero dollars: there is no price point where Sirius
would ever _lose_ money on a customer. Every cent they get from me
is gravy.)

This experience presents some lessons and open questions:

- If you're one of [today's lucky 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
    who didn't know that you can save money by calling Sirius
    and asking the representative to extend your promotional price:
    Now you know!

- Sirius's AI assistant really does streamline the process, and
    perhaps even surfaces it to callers who don't know about it
    (if they happen to call for some other reason).
    That's very customer-friendly. Good for them.

- AI assistants lower the social cost of asking
    ["Can you sell me that Chevy Tahoe for $1?"](https://gizmodo.com/ai-chevy-dealership-chatgpt-bot-customer-service-fail-1851111825)
    You needn't worry that a human representative would ever
    say yes to that; therefore a customer will rarely even
    _ask_ that of a human. But with a chatbot, the social cost
    of _just asking_ is much less.

- Can you in fact get a Sirius XM subscription for $1.99/month?
    For free? That never expires? One interpretation of my
    experience is that maybe $6.99/month was still within
    Sirius's [bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_castle):
    the AI might indeed have refused to offer prices below
    some "reasonable" floor, located somewhere below $6.99.

- I believe the "call and ask" tactic also works to get or
    extend promotional price deals in the phone, cable, and
    Internet spheres (Verizon, Comcast, Cox, etc.) where there's a
    lot of money sloshing around and they operate mostly on the
    "profit by obscurity" model. But these are in some sense
    old-school companies. Does it work on current-generation,
    Silicon-Valley-colored "profit by obscurity" companies
    like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon, Audible?

- Does the tactic work on companies _with_ marginal costs,
    such as utilities (Con Edison)? I'm guessing no.
    Calling Con Ed may still help people with _actual_ financial hardship
    [enroll](https://www.coned.com/en/accounts-billing/payment-plans-assistance/energy-affordability-program)
    in programs like New York's [HEAP](https://otda.ny.gov/programs/heap/),
    but that's not the tactic I'm talking about in this post.

[Teddi Deppner complains](https://www.teddideppner.com/2025/03/audible-billing-charges-the-ways-amazon-profits-by-obscuring-basic-account-information/)
(March 2025) about "profit by obscurity" at Audible,
but never tried calling Audible's phone number.
In my experience, the operative factor is _always_ that you
have to call on the phone; I'd never expect to be able to get
a discount via email, online chat, or any other medium
where there wasn't an individual named person on the
other end of the line who was socially invested
in a happy and timely resolution.

That's why I found it so noteworthy that Sirius XM's AI assistant
actually did give me the deal — in fact volunteered it! in fact
sweetened it on request! I would have expected an AI with no social
investment in the conversation to be frustratingly inflexible.
(But if it had been, then I would have pressed `0` until a human
showed up. Sirius presumably knows this, and knows that it can't
save money on call centers unless people _like_ interacting with its AI.)
