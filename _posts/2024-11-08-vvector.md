This morning I watched the video of Christopher Fretz's talk from
C++Now 2024, ["Designing a Slimmer Vector of C++ Variants."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWC_aA7iyKc)
I recommend it! I found two interesting things to say about it:

First, [around the 40-minute mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWC_aA7iyKc&t=2393s),
Chris gives a pretty good rundown of what "alignment" means in C++. In my training classes
I've found that people are generally aware of `sizeof(T)`, and can explain that it's the
number of bytes required to store a `T` — its meaning is pretty clear and calculable _a priori_.
It often comes as news to them that there's this second magic number, `alignof(T)`, which represents
the number _n_ such that "if a `T` object's address is ever nonzero modulo _n_, then the hardware
might make bad stuff happen" — and its value often seems arbitrary, determined _a posteriori_ from
the instruction set and sometimes from ABI conventions too. If you've never heard of alignment,
or you've heard of the `alignof` keyword but don't know what it does, then I recommend this
part of Chris's talk.

Second, [around 43 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWC_aA7iyKc&t=2547s),
Chris shows that his "vector of variants" data structure gives rise to a really interesting
situation. Watch the full talk for details; but basically, where an ordinary `vector<variant<A,B>>`
looks like this:

...Chris's `vvector<A,B>` looks like this instead ([Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/KP4o6bqzE)):

It manages a buffer of raw memory into which we construct elements of type `A` or `B`,
plus a separate vector of "metadata" that tells us for each element what type it is (`A` or `B`)
and where it's located (as a byte offset into the buffer).

When we insert a new element at the beginning of the container, we need to shift down the
other elements to make room, just like we would when inserting into a `std::vector`.
Each existing element is _relocated_ from its current byte offset to an offset further down
in the buffer. In [P1144-land](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2024/p1144r12.html),
`std::vector::insert` simply uses `std::uninitialized_relocate_backward(p, p+n, q)` where the
ranges `p` and `q` happen to overlap because `q == p+1`.

But here's what happens when we insert an `A` object at the beginning of our `vvector` from above:

![](/blog/images/2024-11-08-vvector-3.png)

This is the interesting situation I promised you. Notice that the first `B` object (the original `vv[0]`)
used to be located at offset `0`, occupying bytes 0,1,2,3,4,5.
After the insertion, it's now at offset `4`, occupying bytes 4,5,6,7,8,9.
So the operation here is, again, a relocation from `p` to `q`, where `p` and `q` happen to overlap... but
this time `p` and `q` aren't ranges; they're _single objects!_ When `B` is trivially relocatable, that's fine:
`memmove` automatically handles overlapping ranges of bytes and doesn't care how many objects are
involved. But for non-trivially-relocatable objects, this operation cannot be performed by:

    std::construct_at(q, std::move(*p));
    std::destroy_at(p);

nor by (P1144):

    std::relocate_at(p, q);

No, it has to be done with the help of a temporary object, for example like this (P1144):

    std::construct_at(q, std::relocate(p));

The line above relocates from `p` into a materialized temporary, then move-constructs into `q`,
then (at the end of the full-expression) destroys the temporary.

> Watch out! `::new (q) T(std::relocate(p))` would have UB instead, because `std::relocate(p)`

What's the lesson here? Are we worried enough about this kind of use-case to suggest that
`std::uninitialized_relocate` and/or `std::relocate_at` ought to guard against this kind of
partial-object overlap? For example, instead of specifying that `relocate_at` move-constructs from `src` to `dest`
and then destroys `src`, we could respecify it to move-construct from `src` to `tmp`, destroy `src`, move-construct
from `tmp` to `dest`, and finally destroy `tmp`. But in real life — no. That would lose tons of performance
in the _expected_ use-cases (such as `vector` and `rotate`). I'm quite
confident that the real lesson here is: If you're doing odd things with byte offsets, you should watch out for
pitfalls. But this is a really cool use-case and a really fun and interesting situation Chris found himself in!
I enjoyed hearing about it.
