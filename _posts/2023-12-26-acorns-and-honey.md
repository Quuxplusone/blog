Hesiod's _Works and Days_ ([trans. H.G. Evelyn-White](https://www.theoi.com/Text/HesiodWorksDays.html))
on the Ages of Man:

> First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race of mortal men
> who [...] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief:
> miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry
> with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were
> overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare
> them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands
> with many good things, rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods.
>
> But after earth had covered this generation [...the gods] made a second generation,
> which was of silver and less noble by far. [...] A child was brought up at his good mother's side
> a hundred years [... but in adulthood] they lived only a little time in sorrow,
> for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another.
>
> [W]hen earth had covered this generation also [...] Zeus the Father made a third generation
> of mortal men, a brazen race, sprung from ash-trees; and it was in no way equal to the silver age,
> but was terrible and strong. They loved the lamentable works of Ares and deeds of violence;
> [...] terrible though they were, black Death seized them, and they left the bright light of the sun.

On good conduct:

> Neither famine nor disaster ever haunt men who do true justice [...]
> The earth bears them victual in plenty, and on the mountains the oak
> bears acorns upon the top and bees in the midst.

(Plato quotes this latter part in [_Republic_ 363](https://archive.org/details/republicplato05platgoog/page/n84/mode/1up).)

Acorns remind Don Quixote of a lost Golden Age (part I, chapter XI, [trans. Rutherford](https://amzn.to/3RzxTYd)):

> Once the meat course was finished, a quantity of sweet acorns was spread on the sheepskins
> together with half a cheese [...] After Don Quixote had satisfied his stomach he took up a
> handful of acorns and, gazing at them, held forth as follows:
>
> "Happy the age and happy the centuries were those on which the ancients bestowed the name
> of golden, not because gold (so prized in our age of iron) was then to be obtained with
> ease, but because [...] all things were held in common; no man, to gain his daily
> sustenance, had need to take any other pains than to reach up and pluck it from the
> sturdy oaks [...] the running streams offered him their delectable and transparent waters
> [...] and in the hollows of trees, diligent and prudent bees formed their commonwealths,
> offering to every hand, without requesting anything in return, the rich harvest of
> their sweet labours. [...]"
>
> This long harangue (which could well have been dispensed with) was pronounced by our
> knight because the acorns he'd been given had reminded him of the golden age; and so
> it occurred to him to offer these useless arguments to the goatherds, who listened without
> uttering a word, bemused and bewildered.

Plutarch, in his _Life of Coriolanus_ 3.3
([trans. Perrin](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Coriolanus*.html#3.3)),
also eulogizes the oak for its acorns and honey:

> The oak, moreover, has the most beautiful fruit of all wild trees,
> and is the sturdiest of all trees under cultivation. Its acorn used
> to be food, and the honey found in it used to be drink for men [...]

["Acorns in ancient texts"](https://oldeuropeanculture.blogspot.com/2015/10/acorns-in-ancient-text.html) (Old European Culture, October 2015)
lists more appearances of the ancient acorn. It seems to have been a meme
that the aboriginal Arcadians were acorn-eaters, both in the most ancient times
and soon after the death of Lycurgus
([Didorus Siculus 9.36](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/9*.html#36),
[Herodotus 1.66](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1B*.html#66)).
Apollonius Rhodius' _Argonautica_ ([trans. R.C. Seaton](https://www.theoi.com/Text/ApolloniusRhodius4.html))
describes those olden days:

> As yet all the stars that wheel in the heaven were not; nor yet [...] could aught be heard of the sacred race of the Danai.
> Apidanean Arcadians alone existed, Arcadians who lived even before the moon, it is said, eating acorns on the hills [...]
> in the days when Egypt, mother of men of an older time, was called the fertile Morning-land [...]

There is a modern thesis
([1](https://earthandstarryheaven.com/2015/04/07/honey-ash/), [2](http://www.musaios.com/ash.htm))
— maybe credible, certainly memetically successful — that the ancients were
said to feed on honey dripping from the trees through a conflation of _μέλι_ "honey" with [_μελίαι_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliae)
"ash-trees." The [manna ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_ornus) exudes a sweet sap known as manna;
recall that Yggdrasil, [which drips with honey-dew](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AThe_Prose_Edda_(1916_translation_by_Arthur_Gilchrist_Brodeur).pdf/62),
is an ash. (Hesiod, likewise, says the men of the Bronze Age descended from the _μελίαι_; but in that case
the connection is with their warlike nature — ash [is](https://acoup.blog/2023/11/10/collections-the-mediterranean-iron-omni-spear/)
a good wood for spear-hafts.) In modern times, [honeydew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_(secretion))
is the name for sap that's already passed through an aphid or other sap-sucking insect (as opposed to oozing
straight out of the tree perhaps through a hole _made_ by an insect). This sweet secretion can indeed be collected
by bees and turned into honey — Turkish [pine honey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_honey) is of this type.
