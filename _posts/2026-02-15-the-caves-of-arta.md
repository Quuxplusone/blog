I recently read, and enjoyed, David Owen's
["The Objectively Objectionable Grammatical Pet Peeve"](https://archive.is/JqOpO)
(January 2023). The objectionable practice in question is what Fowler
[calls](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.65263/page/423)
the "sentry participle," a participle or appositive stuck on the front of
a sentence that could just as well have done without it. For example:

> Known affectionately as "the girls,"
> Ruth and Emily have a lot of fun for two Asian elephants.

Often associated with newspaper obituaries and puff pieces, the practice is
(Owen says) relatively new to English. Er, ahem: Owen says this particular practice
is relatively new to English, having gained currency from the kind of "journalese"
seen in newspaper obituaries and puff pieces only since the early 20th century.

I hypothesize (or admit) that the use of sentry participles might be a symptom
of the writer's failing to think out the whole sentence before starting to write.
Instead of thinking in full sentences, you can start with just a participial phrase —
the kind of thing you'd see in a bulleted list on a PowerPoint slide — and defer
for a few seconds the unpleasant task of turning that bullet point into a full sentence.

> The awkwardness is obvious if you imagine hearing one in conversation.
> No one has ever said to you, "A sophomore at Cornell, my niece is coming home for Christmas."
> [...] Yet if you were, let's say, writing an obituary for your college's alumni magazine,
> you wouldn't hesitate: "A standout schoolboy athlete, he ran his family's
> door-and-window business."

Today, via Language Log posts on [the purported etymology of "limerick"](https://languagehat.com/the-history-of-the-limerick/) (April 2017)
and [orthographical limericks](https://languagehat.com/orthographical-limericks/) (August 2008),
and [this circa-2000 time capsule of the Old Web](http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/bywater/ee_res9a.htm):

> [The Baron of Fawsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_St_John-Stevas), Lord St John,  
> Had a fine buckskin coat with a frt john.  
> He said, "It was guthven  
> Me by [Viscount Ruthven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Gowrie)—  
> Who must think I'm a cowboy, or t john."

The same page introduced me to the following bit of doggerel from Robert Graves'
(yes, [_that_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Graves) Robert Graves')
otherwise inutile 1951 collection [_Poems and Satires_](https://archive.org/details/poemssatires0000rgra/page/31).
The following, which reminds me of Edgar Allan Poe (in the way it combines
["A Predicament"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Predicament)&thinsp;’s addlepated excess with
["The Domain of Arnheim"](https://www.eapoe.org/works/stedwood/sw0208.htm)&thinsp;’s kublakhanity)
is printed under the title “¡Wellcome, to the Caves of Arta!”

> <i>"They are hollowed out in the see coast at the muncipal terminal of
> Capdepera, at nine kilometer from the town of Arta in the Island of
> Mallorca, with a suporizing infinity of graceful colums of 21 meter
> and by downward, which prives the spectator of all animacion and
> plunges in dumbness. The way going is very picturesque, serpentine
> between style mountains, til the arrival at the esplanade of the vallee
> called «The Spiders». There are good enlacements of the railroad with
> autobuses of excursion, many days of the week, today actually Wednesday
> and Satturday. Since many centuries renown foreing visitors have
> explored them and wrote their elegy about, included Nort-American
> geoglogues."</i>  
> &emsp; [From a tourist leaflet.]

> Such subtle filigranity and nobless of construccion  
> &emsp; Here fraternise in harmony, that respiracion stops.  
> While all admit their impotence (though autors most formidable)  
> &emsp; To sing in words the excellence of Nature's underprops,  
> Yet stalactite and stalagmite together with dumb langage  
> &emsp; Make hymnes to God which celebrate the stregnth of water drops.

> ¿You, also, are you capable to make precise in idiom  
> &emsp; Consideracions magic of ilusions very wide?  
> Already in the Vestibule of these Grand Caves of Arta  
> &emsp; The spirit of the human verb is darked and stupefied;  
> So humildy you trespass trough the forest of the colums  
> &emsp; And listen to the grandess explicated by the guide.

> From darkness into darkness, but at measure now descending,

> Too far do not adventure, sir! For, further as you wander,
