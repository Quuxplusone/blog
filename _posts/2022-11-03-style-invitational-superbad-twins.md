The _Washington Post_'s Style Invitational competition (modeled on Mary Ann Madden's _New York_
magazine competition of bygone years, [which see](https://amzn.to/3U2XmsZ)) just revealed the
[results of Week 1509's contest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/11/03/style-invitational-1513-greeting-cards-movie-mashups/),
in which the task was to combine two one-word movie titles
and describe the resulting flick. Our household sent in a bunch, and one got ink, although I
didn't think it was the best of those I submitted _and_ I didn't think the Empress's
massaged tagline was any improvement.

* <span class="headline">Maleficent Us</span>: The sequel to "Despicable Me."

The non-inking entries ranged from the topical (<span class="headline">Suddenly Twilight</span>: "Daylight
Savings Time ends") to the unprintable (and therefore unprinted).
Frankly I'm surprised that this trio of classy French-themed entries failed to garner even a tittle of ink:

* <span class="headline">Chocolat Pi</span>: This ode to dessert has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen.
* <span class="headline">Tenet 8Â½</span>: _Dix-huit et demi._
* <span class="headline">Ratatouille Holes</span>: Non-narrative film focuses on the mouths of everyday Parisians.

Other non-inkers included:

* <span class="headline">Orca Frankenstein</span>: Directed by James Whale.
* <span class="headline">Heat Shrink</span>: A Hollywood gaffer's investigation into counterfeit electrical components lands him in the middle of an armored-car heist on Santa Monica Boulevard in this convoluted Elmore Leonard neo-noir.
* <span class="headline">Argo Fargo</span>: Jason turns his back on the famous ship.
* <span class="headline">Titanic Hamlet</span>: _Metropolis._
* <span class="headline">Badlands, GoodFellas</span>: And good lands make bad fellas.
* <span class="headline">Big Finch</span>: Tom Hanks attempts to distinguish fact from fantasy in the Galapagos notebooks of his beloved evolutionary-biologist father.
* <span class="headline">Speed Freaks</span>: Directed by Harmony Korine.
* <span class="headline">Okja Ouija</span>: A linguist (Jim Carrey) finds himself mysteriously unable to say "no" to anything.
* <span class="headline">Blow-Up Aliens</span>: Directed by Michael Bay.
* <span class="headline">Diabolique Stripes</span>: The treacherous nature of the wild tiger. <i>(Calvin, age 6.)</i>
* <span class="headline">Flightplan: Up</span>: On a new airplane's maiden voyage, nothing goes wrong.
* <span class="headline">Nope Antz</span>: Documentary. An illiterate nudist explains his way of life.
* <span class="headline">High-Rise Downfall</span>: _Gravity._
* <span class="headline">Chinatown Sneakers</span>: Counterfeit-footwear documentary.
* <span class="headline">Speedway Up</span>: "Floor it!"
* <span class="headline">Alien Pocahontas</span>: Working title of James Cameron's _Avatar_ (2009).
* <span class="headline">Thor Luther</span>: The 1990 Tyson/Douglas matchup.
* <span class="headline">Casino Wanted</span>: But we bought a zoo instead.
* <span class="headline">Clifford Ran</span>: Kaiju disaster movie for children.
* <span class="headline">Frozen Scoop</span>: The history of ice cream.
* <span class="headline">Tintin Can-Can</span>: That's it. Tin tin can can. That's the joke.
* <span class="headline">Up Sideways</span>: Diagonally.
