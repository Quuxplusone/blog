The _Washington Post_'s Style Invitational competition (modeled on Mary Ann Madden's _New York_
magazine competition of bygone years, [which see](https://amzn.to/3U2XmsZ)) just revealed the
[results of Week 1509's contest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/11/03/style-invitational-1513-greeting-cards-movie-mashups/),
in which the task was to combine two one-word movie titles
and describe the resulting flick. Our household sent in a bunch, and one got ink, although I
didn't think it was the best of those I submitted _and_ I didn't think the Empress's
massaged tagline was any improvement.

* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Maleficent Us</span>: The sequel to "Despicable Me."

The non-inking entries ranged from the topical (<span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Suddenly Twilight</span>: "Daylight
Savings Time ends") to the unprintable (and therefore unprinted).
Frankly I'm surprised that this trio of classy French-themed entries failed to garner even a tittle of ink:

* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Chocolat Pi</span>: This ode to dessert has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Tenet 8Â½</span>: _Dix-huit et demi._
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Ratatouille Holes</span>: Non-narrative film focuses on the mouths of everyday Parisians.

Other non-inkers included:

* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Orca Frankenstein</span>: Directed by James Whale.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Heat Shrink</span>: A Hollywood gaffer's investigation into counterfeit electrical components lands him in the middle of an armored-car heist on Santa Monica Boulevard in this convoluted Elmore Leonard neo-noir.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Argo Fargo</span>: Jason turns his back on the famous ship.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Titanic Hamlet</span>: _Metropolis._
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Badlands, GoodFellas</span>: And good lands make bad fellas.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Big Finch</span>: Tom Hanks attempts to distinguish fact from fantasy in the Galapagos notebooks of his beloved evolutionary-biologist father.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Speed Freaks</span>: Directed by Harmony Korine.
* <span style="font-variant-caps: all-small-caps">Okja Ouija</span>: A linguist (Jim Carrey) finds himself mysteriously unable to say "no" to anything.
