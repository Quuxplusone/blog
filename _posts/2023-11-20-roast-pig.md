  Happy Thanksgiving! I haven't got a reading on roast turkey, but here are some
  excerpts from Charles Lamb's ["A Dissertation Upon Roast Pig"](https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb4-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PP9)
  (_London Magazine_, [September 1822](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015033845671&seq=293)):

  > I am one of those who freely and ungrudgingly impart a share of the good things of this life
  > which fall to their lot (few as mine are in this kind) to a friend. I protest I take
  > as great an interest in my friend's pleasures, his relishes and proper satisfactions,
  > as in mine own. "Presents," I often say, "endear Absents." Hares, pheasants, partridges,
  > snipes, barn-door chickens (those "[tame villatic fowl](https://archive.org/details/samsonagonistes00miltgoog/page/n71/mode/1up)"),
  > capons, plovers, brawn, barrels of oysters, I dispense as freely as I receive them.
  > I love to taste them, as it were, upon the tongue of my friend.
  >
  > But a stop must be put somewhere.
  > One would not, like Lear, "[give everything.](https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/king-lear/read/2/4/#:~:text=I%20gave%20you%20all)"
  > I make my stand upon pig.

Happy Thanksgiving! I haven't got a reading on roast turkey, but here are some
excerpts from Charles Lamb's ["A Dissertation Upon Roast Pig"](https://books.google.com/books?id=Fb4-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PP9)
(_London Magazine_, [September 1822](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015033845671&seq=293)):

Lamb is of course referring to roast _suckling_ pig, not "your grown porkers,"
not "the maturity of rank bacon."

> See him in the dish, his second cradle, how meek he lieth!— wouldst thou have had
> this innocent grow up to the grossness and indocility which too often accompany
> maturer swinehood? Ten to one he would have proved a glutton, a sloven,
> an obstinate, disagreeable animal — wallowing in all manner of filthy conversation —
> from these sins he is happily snatched away
>
> > [Ere sin could blight or sorrow fade,](https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc4NAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA57)

The blogosphere has an idea that "ham and pineapple" is a 20th-century thing.
(Incidentally, the best kind of pizza is not "Hawaiian" but ham _and onion and mushroom_ and pineapple,
or "HOMP.") The date "1925" comes up a lot, for some reason. But here's Lamb again, in 1822,
linking pig and pineapple:

> Pine-apple is great. She is indeed almost too transcendent — a delight,
> if not sinful, yet so like to sinning that really a tender-conscienced person
> would do well to pause — too ravishing for mortal taste, she woundeth and excoriateth
> the lips that approach her — like lovers' kisses, she biteth — she is a pleasure
> bordering on pain from the fierceness and insanity of her relish. But she stoppeth
> at the palate — she meddleth not with the appetite — and the coarsest hunger might
> barter her consistently for a mutton-chop.

"Roast Pig" extends [a letter on the same theme](https://www.online-literature.com/lamb/best-letters/17/)
sent by Lamb to Coleridge (the author of the "Epitaph on an Infant" quoted above)
after someone had sent Coleridge a pig. (Apparently not Lamb, says the footnote;
although the footnoter might just be taking Lamb's essay too seriously.)
Speaking of letters about sending pigs, in the January 1975 issue of _The Classical Outlook_
J.D. Sadler translates [Martial's _Epigrammata_ 9.48](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/martial_epigrams_book09.htm)
as follows:

> 9.48 (To Garricus)
>
> You swore by an oath that was sacred as Jove  
> That I would inherit a fourth of your trove.  
> I, wishfully thinking that this would come true,  
> Kept sending all manner of presents to you.  
> Among them I gave you a succulent pig;  
> It looked like a monster, the thing was so big.  
> And you gave a barbecue, everything free,  
> To which all were invited — all except me!  
> I can't even wiggle my nose in the door  
> To watch all those bloated bums belching my boar.  
> Not even a knuckle was sent me this late.  
> You still think I'm getting that quarter-estate?

That's the plot of [_Volpone_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4039/4039-h/4039-h.htm), isn't it?
