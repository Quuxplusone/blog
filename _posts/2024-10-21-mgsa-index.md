Today is the 110th birthday of Martin Gardner (1914–2010)! Every year around this date,
various groups hold "Celebration of Mind" festivals. You can find some examples
[on the Gathering 4 Gardner site](https://www.gathering4gardner.org/events-faq/),
although I see at the moment it's a little sparse and 404'ish.

This 110th birthday seems like a good excuse to mention that in the past couple of months
I've helped John Miller add some new data to his online
[index of all Martin Gardner's _Scientific American_ columns](https://martin-gardner.org/MGSAindex.html).
John has been maintaining this list since 1975, and has kept it online since 1999
(see his historical notes [here](https://www.dialectrix.com/G4G/PrimitiveMGIndex.html)).
This year, for the first time, each row of the table contains a link to [JSTOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSTOR)'s
entry for the original _Scientific American_ column.

* If you have a JSTOR account (e.g. through your employer or university), you can
download a PDF of the _Scientific American_ column directly from its JSTOR page.
Otherwise, you just get a preview of the first page of the column.

* JSTOR seems to have a "free plan" where you can create an account and
get access to three articles every two weeks — 78 articles a year. Instructions for
creating a free account directly through JSTOR are [here](https://support.jstor.org/hc/en-us/articles/115004760028-How-to-Register-Get-Free-Access-to-Content).

* If you have a Wikipedia username and use it occasionally, then
you almost certainly have unlimited free access to JSTOR [via the Wikipedia Library](https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/).
(Specifically, you qualify if you've made 10+ edits in the last 30 days, and
500+ edits over 6+ months as a registered user.) And if you don't occasionally
edit Wikipedia — well, why not start? Not only will you contribute to the
collective knowledge of humanity, you'll also get free JSTOR access!

In the future I hope to see John's list expanded also with links to each column as it appeared
when eventually collected in book form. (Perhaps via links to the Internet Archive, assuming they regain
stability and don't just go dark forever after the [ongoing cyberattacks](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/),
publisher lawsuits, etc. This year has certainly made me much more amenable to
[gwern's affinity for "rehosting" versus hyperlinking](https://gwern.net/archiving),
although as of this writing I remain too lazy to actually start doing it.)

This being Gardner's 110th birthday, I wonder whether it would be possible to find a
configuration in Stephen Wolfram's [Rule 110 cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110)
that, when evolved downward, produces output resembling "MG" or a portrait of Gardner or some such.
One might try applying the techniques described in ["Conway's Gradient of Life"](https://hardmath123.github.io/conways-gradient.html)
(Kartik Chandra, May 2020), although I suspect that the two problems are significantly different:
Chandra's problem was to make a configuration that evolved over time to produce a final "snapshot"
with a certain density, whereas what I'm picturing involves a configuration _whose density itself_
evolves over time in a certain way.

However, having other things to do today, I've done nothing more on that subject
than the idle thought recorded above. If you have ideas (or even better, solutions), email me
and I'll happily credit you here!
