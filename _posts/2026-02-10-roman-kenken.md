The other day my wife suggested the idea of [KenKen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen) "with letters."
There's probably an idea in there related to anagrams, somehow; but the first idea that popped into my
head was to use Roman numerals. Here's a "*really* Latin square" for you to solve:

Fill in each cell in this 4×4 grid with one of the Roman numerals C, L, X, V, such that each numeral
appears exactly once in each row and in each column, and each of the three dark-bordered "cages" contains
numerals summing exactly to the given value.

I don't do enough KenKen to know if this puzzle is unusually easy, or difficult, or whatever.

KenKen newbies should note that the label "CCX+" means "this cage sums to _exactly_ 210"; the plus sign
is there merely to indicate the math operation being used. Ordinary KenKen puzzles feature cages with
not just addition but also subtraction, multiplication, and division.
KenKen puzzles featuring only multiplication are known as
[_inshi no heya_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshi_no_heya); I don't know if there's a name
for puzzles like this one featuring only addition.

This puzzle also has two unlabeled cages; that's not typical of the genre, and probably shows how little
expertise I have in KenKen construction. But labeling them would have made the puzzle _definitely_ too easy.
