With apologies to William Wordsworth and Mel Tormé.

> Blessed nuns fret not at their narrow rooms;  
> Hermits fret not at their cells;  
> Maids at their wheels, those who weave with their looms,  
> And students in their citadels  
> Happiness indwells. A blithe and humble little bee  
> Will sit and murmur by the hour;  
> High on a peak overlooking the sea  
> But nestled deep within a flower.  
>
> They know in scanty plots of ground  
> In sundry moods, 'tis pastime to be bound;  
> And to shed the weight of liberty  
> Can sometimes really make you more free.  
>
> In truth, the prison into which we doom  
> Ourselves no prison is; I'll be  
> Pleased if some souls (they exist, I assume)  
> Find brief solace — here with me.
