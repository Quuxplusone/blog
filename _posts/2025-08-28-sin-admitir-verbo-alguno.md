excerpt: |
  In Cervantes' [_Coloquio de los perros_](https://people.duke.edu/%7Egarci/garcitextos/bilingues/CERVANTES-MD/NOVELAS-EJEMPLARES/COLOQUIO-PERROS.HTM)
  (published 1613), a dog recounts all the colorful characters he's met in his life.
  One is this frustrated poet:

  > "I have strictly observed the rule laid down by Horace in his _Poetica_ not to bring to light
  > any work until ten years after it has been composed. Now I have a work on which I was engaged
  > for twenty years, and which has lain by me for twelve [...]
  > a lofty, sonorous, heroic poem, delectable and full of matter; and yet
  > I cannot find a prince to whom I may dedicate it."
  >
  > "What is the subject of the work?" inquired the alchemist.
  >
  > "It treats," said the poet, "of that part of the history of King Arthur of England which
  > Archbishop Turpin left unwritten, together with the history of the quest of the Holy Grail;
  > and all in heroic verse, part in rhymes and part in blank verse; but entirely dactylically—I
  > mean in dactylic noun substantives, without admitting any verb whatsoever."

I was struck by this conceit: a poem _all_ in nouns, with no verbs at all?
Naïvely, it reminds me of Jorge Luis Borges'
[_Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius_](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-Tl%C3%B6n-Uqbar-Orbius-Tertius.pdf),
in whose "conjectural Ursprache"

> there are no nouns [...] there are impersonal verbs, modified by monosyllabic suffixes (or prefixes)

> which in Spanish would be "lunecer" or "lunar." In [...] the northern hemisphere the prime unit is

> They do not say "luna," but rather "aéreo-claro sobre oscuro-redondo" [...]

Did Cervantes have the same kind of idea 350 years earlier? (Spoiler alert: No. We'll get to
what he _actually_ meant in part 2 of this series. But it does strike me as plausible that Borges
might have gotten his idea from what Cervantes wrote.)

Over on [Literature StackExchange](https://literature.stackexchange.com/questions/29609/a-poem-in-nombres-sustantivos-sin-admitir-verbo-alguno),
Peter Shor pointed out that in the 20th century, Imagist poets such as Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams
did in fact produce verbless or almost-verbless poems, albeit short ones.
Pound's famous "In a Station of the Metro" (1913) is verbless:

> The apparition of these faces in the crowd:  
> Petals on a wet, black bough.

Half a century earlier, here's [Afanasy Fet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasy_Fet)'s verbless
["Шепот"](https://archive.org/details/1959_20220515/page/211) ("Whispers"; 1850),
with an equally verbless English translation by
[Boris Dralyuk](https://bdralyuk.wordpress.com/2019/02/13/the-dewy-lustrous-petals-of-this-rose-afanasy-fets-late-love/):

But in neither case is the poem composed entirely of nouns; it merely eschews verbs. And even if it were all nouns,
those nouns wouldn't be solely _dactyls!_ Dactyls are the things you have two of in each line of a
[double dactyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dactyl). Intriguingly enough, if you had to
pick a subject for a poem composed _entirely_ of dactyls, you could do much worse than Arthurian romance.
Almost all their proper nouns are dactyls — Camelot, Guinevere, Galahad, Avalon — and almost all their
abstractions — piety, chastity, gallantry, bravery.

Anyway, inspired by Cervantes' poet, the other week I went and wrote a hundred-line poem
(loosely speaking) on the quest of the Holy Grail, entirely in words that are both dactyls
and nouns. It is, obviously, _not_ a masterpiece. I could sit on it for nine years,
[as Horace advises](https://archive.org/details/horacesatiresspi0000unse/page/483)...
but where's the fun in that? Instead, I'll sit on my poem for another nine days or so,
hoping that some gentle reader might take up the idea from this post and create something
of their own, too.

This series continues with ["A poem all in dactylic noun substantives, part 2,"](/blog/2025/08/30/sin-admitir-verbo-alguno-part-2/)
in which I explain what Cervantes' poet actually meant by "_todo esdrújulamente,
digo en esdrújulos de nombres sustantivos, sin admitir verbo alguno._"
