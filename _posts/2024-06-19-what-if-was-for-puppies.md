This past weekend I finished reading Gretchen McCulloch's
entertaining 2019 book on "the new rules of language," _Because Internet_.
Top takeaways:

---

Emoji (emojis?) are _gestures_: they can reinforce a verbal message
(the stereotypical-old-person's "going🚗 to buy bread🍞 do you need anything??")
or even convey certain kinds of nonverbal message by themselves
("💕💕", "🎉", "🙏" — the latter literally representing a bodily gesture).
You couldn't write _Hamlet_ in emoji any more than you could write _Hamlet_
using only gestures. But, as McCulloch astutely points out (p. 192),
Shakespeare's actual _Hamlet_ was always intended to be _accompanied_ by gestures!
(See ["Booth on Cassio"](/blog/2019/01/05/booth-on-cassio/) (2019-01-05).)

The notion of "gesture" also explains why emoji can be repeated for emphasis,
and combined in a relatively order-free way: "🎊🎆🥂" and "🥂🎊🎆" mean exactly
the same thing, whereas reordered *verbal* phrases like
["old green knife" and "green old knife"](/blog/2021/04/03/static-constexpr-whittling-knife/)
really don't feel quite synonymous.

McCulloch observes that we needed text-messaging in order for video-calling to
be adopted. The historical norm for telephone calls (even after the invention of Caller ID)
was to pick up no matter what; what [Hopper 1992](https://archive.org/details/telephoneconvers00hopp/page/199/mode/1up)
calls "caller hegemony."

> Consider the following scene: You and your best loved one are having the
> most difficult argument you can remember. S/he has just escalated the
> argument by calling you a terrible name. You ready a stinging retort,
> but just then the phone rings. Do you answer it? The overwhelming majority
> of the hundreds of individuals to whom I have posed that question indicate
> that they would answer the telephone even on such an extreme occasion.

Twenty-five years later, McCulloch reports, the overwelt was in the
opposite direction. And why? Well, if it's really important they'll text.
Or, god forbid, leave a voicemail.

With such a norm, how could video calling ever catch on? A video call needs to
be planned, staged — you can hop out of the shower or roll over in bed to pick
up the phone, but you can't do the same with a video call. Stanley Kubrick
was showing video payphones in _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968), but it took
until the 2010s for Skype and Zoom to go mainstream. The missing ingredient
was the low-bandwidth, low-stakes, high-latency medium over which to _set up_
the high-stakes video call: "Hey, got time for a Zoom tonight?"

McCulloch spends some pages talking about the linguistics of Internet animals,
from the 2000s' lolcats to the 2020s' doge and snek. This reminded me of a meme
that's been in mine and my wife's household lexicon for a while, that I might as well share
here. It all started with [this 2014 Tumblr comic](https://yellowcomics.tumblr.com/post/98850504007/not-for-puppies-support-me-on-patreon)
by [Grace Culloton](https://sundog.lol/):

![](/blog/images/2024-06-19-not-for-puppies.png)

For years I'd read this comic as:

> PERSON: \*preparing a sandwich\*<br>
> &nbsp; no no<br>
> &nbsp; Not for puppies
>
> DOG:<br>
> &nbsp; Okay, but like...<br>
> &nbsp; what if<br>
> &nbsp; <b>was</b> for puppies

And so this became a [phrasal template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_template) for us.

Suppose we're driving home, where there's food; we probably shouldn't stop at McDonalds on the way; but like<br>
what if<br>
*did* stop at McDonalds?

---

Now, the thing I noticed only several years later — if you noticed it right away, this
part will be much less interesting to you — is that the dog doesn't actually say

> what if<br>
> <b>was</b> for puppies

at all! He says

> what if it<br>
> <b>was</b> for puppies,

with the pronoun. It's just that by the time I first encountered this comic I'd totally
internalized the stereotypical way that dogs talk on the Internet, and part of that
stereotype is ever-so-slightly-askew grammar. (Turns out, [on the Internet *can* tell
you're a dog.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog))

Another relevant observation by McCulloch (p. 110):
"For people whose linguistic
norms are oriented towards the offline world, the most neutral way of separating 
one utterance from the next is with a dash or a string of dots. [...]
For people whose linguistic norms are oriented to the internet, the most
neutral way of indicating an utterance is with a new line or message break."
(Pp.&nbsp;209–217 discuss how the "chat" paradigm graduated from IRC and AIM to
its modern ubiquity. Your phone *could* present text messages with an
"email inbox" paradigm; but it doesn't; it presents texts as a stream of newline-separated
utterances instead. Texts, timelines, blog comments: everything is chat now.)

So when I think of how that dog's utterance should be punctuated — well, it's just
like in the comic, right? There's no dot-dot-dot, no comma; just new speech bubble,
new panel, new line. The little word "it", at the end of the line, easily and naturally
gets lost. Consider this alternative dialogue option:

> what if<br>
> it <b>was</b> for puppies

Less chance of losing the "it" in that version, isn't there? I wonder if the
vertical structure of internet text encourages the placement of important words
at line-beginnings, and thus encourages the erosion of small and unimportant words
*particularly* when they immediately precede a stressed word (and thus would be
placed at line-endings).

Anyway, I recommend [_Because Internet_](https://amzn.to/3xnWcST). Go read it!
