excerpt: |
  Earlier this year I joined a book club reading _Don Quijote_ and got deep enough into it to seek out
  the "false second volume of _Quijote_" of [Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonso_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Avellaneda),
  the book that Don Quixote catches Don Jerónimo and Don Juan reading in Chapter 59
  of Cervantes' actual Part II. 

  > "Why do you want us to read all that nonsense, Don Juan? Nobody who has read the
  > first part of the history of Don Quixote de la Mancha can possibly derive any
  > pleasure from reading this second part."
  >
  > "All the same," said Don Juan, "it'll be as well to read it, because there's no
  > book so bad that there isn't something good in it."

Earlier this year I joined a book club reading _Don Quijote_ and got deep enough into it to seek out
the "false second volume of _Quijote_" of [Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonso_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Avellaneda) (1614),
the book that Don Quixote catches Don Jerónimo and Don Juan reading in Chapter 59
of Cervantes' actual Part II.

(_Don Quijote_ II.59, [trans. Rutherford](https://amzn.to/3UyVYAI).)

Avellaneda's "false _Quijote_" was translated into English by Alberta Wilson Server
and John Esten Keller in 1980 ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3AxT4W3)), and eventually I
bought that translation and read it. It's entertaining and accurate, if somewhat
riddled with typos in the 2009 edition. But the first English version of "Avellaneda"
I'd found was [Yardley's](https://books.google.com/books?id=DrgGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1),
which isn't a translation of Avellaneda's Spanish original at all: it's a translation
of a 1704 adaptation by [Alain-René Lesage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain-Ren%C3%A9_Lesage),
in which Lesage deviates significantly from what we usually expect of a "translator" —
cutting some subplots, expanding others, dragging in whole episodes from elsewhere
(including from Cervantes' own Part II), and completely changing the ending!

Realizing the extent of this metafictional morass, I came across an interesting essay
on exactly this subject — "Avellaneda's _Don Quijote_, its relationship to Cervantes,
and its adaptation by Lesage" — the doctoral dissertation (1906) of one Martin Wolf,
later [published](https://books.google.com/books?id=8ipKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1) in the
_Journal of Comparative Literature Studies_ (1909). Only one
problem: it was in German! So I translated Wolf's essay from German to English.
(I promise I didn't knowingly commit any Lesage-level trickery in this translation.)

I leaned heavily on machine translation, pasting a paragraph at a time into
Google Translate and then tweaking until the sense seemed right. Google Translate,
like most "AI" (large-language-model) tools, is actually really helpful for this
kind of human-supervised task. Unsupervised, of course, it would have made a dog's
breakfast of the text in multiple ways. Wolf's academic language is sometimes
"not un-difficult" to parse, or even ambiguous; and the essay incorporates text
in German, Spanish, and French as well as small amounts of English, Italian, Latin,
and Swedish.

Last year I used Google Chrome's built-in "Translate this page" feature to read
Maurice Renard's science-fiction tale [_Le péril bleu_](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_P%C3%A9ril_bleu) (1911);
on that kind of single-language straightforward pulp fiction, machine translation
actually works quite well, as long as you're willing to treat the text a little
impressionistically, and to mentally retranslate a few tricky words and idioms.
For example, in _The Blue Peril_ Google's machine translation often confused
French _voler_ "fly" with _voler_ "steal."

For the HTML and CSS styling of my transcriptions, I am indebted to Bill Thayer's
[Lacus Curtius](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/home.html) website,
which I find amazingly readable; and for the idea of using dotted lines for hyperlinks
(much less obtrusive than the default blue-text-solid-underline style) I'm indebted to
[gwern.net](https://gwern.net/about).

In the German transcription I've tried to be completely faithful to what Wolf wrote,
except for fixing simple typographical errors; if he got a page number or a name
wrong, I've just marked it up with a little CSS tooltip for the correction.
In the English translation, I erred in the other direction, quietly fixing errata without
any markup, and using CSS tooltips only for places where I think I myself have
technical issues with the translation (e.g. phrases I guessed at).

I also used CSS to color-code each quotation from Cervantes' _Quijote_; from Avellaneda's;
and from Lesage's; and I hyperlinked Wolf's sources to archive.org and/or Google Books
whenever I could track them down.

If you find an error, or (being fluent in German) can improve the translation of any line,
or confirm any translation I've marked up with the "unclear" CSS class, please send me an
email and let me know!
