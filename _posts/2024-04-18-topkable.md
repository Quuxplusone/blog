Building on yesterday's post ["Name lookup in multiple base classes"](/blog/2024/04/17/name-lookup-in-base-classes/) (2024-04-17),
Seth Bromberger and I recently talked about the following library-design problem involving
(or at least seeming to involve) exactly that issue. The shape of the problem is:

- We have a class `Graph` whose constructor takes a collection of data and puts the top `k`
    values into a nice graph. Its constructor will be templated to work with any collection
    `c`, as long as `c.topk(10)` yields a result of type `vector<Datum>`.

- We have, let's say, four different collection types that are usable with `Graph`; let's call them
    `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D`. Let's say that `A` and `B` provide not only `.topk(int) const` but also
    a "consuming" or "pilfering" version of `topk`, which erases the returned elements from the collection.
    `C` provides only the non-mutating `topk`. `D` provides only the pilfering version!

- We would certainly like `Graph` to be able to use the "pilfering" version of `topk` in certain
    circumstances; but equally surely, constructing a `Graph` from some collection `x` shouldn't
    mutate `x` by default — not unless we opt in somehow.

- We want to write the bulk of `topk`'s implementation just once, e.g. via a base class,
    instead of having to implement it in each of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.
    And likewise for the pilfering version.

## Approach 1: Move semantics

Notice that these requirements have _almost exactly_ the same shape as C++11 move semantics! So one way to implement
this would be:

    struct Datum {};

    struct PlainTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) const;  // non-mutating
    };

    struct PilferingTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) &&;     // pilfering
    };

    struct BothTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) const&; // non-mutating
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) &&;     // pilfering
    };

    struct A : BothTopkable {};
    struct B : BothTopkable {};
    struct C : PlainTopkable {};
    struct D : PilferingTopkable {};

    struct Graph {
      template<class Coll>
      explicit Graph(int k, Coll&& c) {
        data_ = std::forward<Coll>(c).topk(k);
      }

    private:
      std::vector<Datum> data_;
    };

    A a;
    C c;
    Graph g1 = Graph(10, a);            // non-mutating
    Graph g2 = Graph(10, std::move(a)); // pilfer the top 10
    Graph g3 = Graph(10, c);            // non-mutating
    Graph g4 = Graph(10, std::move(c)); // non-mutating

However, this has two potential downsides. One: The way `g2` opts into pilfering the top `k` elements
of `a` is by doing `std::move(a)`, which looks like you're "giving up" the entire object `a`. In fact
you're merely pilfering its top 10 elements; the others remain available; and the resulting object `a`
is still in a usable state. This feels like a misuse of `std::move` terminology.

Two: `g4` "opted in" to pilfering from `c`, but in fact `c` doesn't provide the pilfering version of `topk`,
so it quietly fell back to the non-mutating version. That's the right thing for move semantics, but it's not
what we want here. (Suppose the caller assumed that `c` would now be ten elements smaller, and wrote code
based on that assumption!) We want a noisy error if `Graph` asks to pilfer from a non-pilferable collection type.

## Approach 2: `pilfering_topk`

The answer to the title question of my C++Now 2021 talk
["When Should You Give Two Things the Same Name?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQgFEkgKx2s)
is "only when it's needed for a technical reason," i.e., basically never. So let's apply that guideline here.

    struct Datum {};

    struct PlainTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) const;     // non-mutating
    };

    struct PilferingTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> pilfering_topk(int k); // pilfering
    };

    struct A : PlainTopkable, PilferingTopkable {};
    struct B : PlainTopkable, PilferingTopkable {};
    struct C : PlainTopkable {};
    struct D : PilferingTopkable {};

    struct Graph {
      template<class Coll>
      static Graph from_collection(int k, const Coll& c) {
        return Graph(c.topk(k));
      }

      template<class Coll>
      static Graph pilfered_from_collection(int k, Coll& c) {
        return Graph(c.pilfering_topk(k));
      }

    private:
      explicit Graph(std::vector<Datum> v) : data_(std::move(v)) {}
      std::vector<Datum> data_;
    };

    A a;
    C c;
    Graph g1 = Graph::from_collection(10, a);
    Graph g2 = Graph::pilfered_from_collection(10, a);
    Graph g3 = Graph::from_collection(10, c);
    Graph g4 = Graph::pilfered_from_collection(10, c); // error

I think it's "more convenient than you think" to provide named factory functions like
`pilfered_from_collection` instead of a gigantic constructor overload set. However, I admit
it can be unwieldy sometimes — or impossible, if your `Graph` needs to be immovable for some
reason.

> Re factory functions, see ["Is your constructor an object-factory or a type-conversion?"](/blog/2018/06/21/factory-vs-conversion/) (2018-06-21).
> Re dealing with immovable types, see ["The Superconstructing Super Elider"](/blog/2018/05/17/super-elider-round-2/) (2018-05-17).

So we _might_ say that we have a "good technical reason" to give the two ways
of constructing `Graph`s the same name (that is, to put them both into the constructor
overload set). Then we'd have to use a tag type to differentiate them (cf. the STL's
use of `std::allocator_arg` and `std::in_place` tags):

    struct PilferTag { explicit PilferTag() = default; };

    struct Graph {
      template<class Coll>
      explicit Graph(int k, const Coll& c) {
        data_ = c.topk(k);
      }

      template<class Coll>
      explicit Graph(int k, const Coll& c, PilferTag) {
        data_ = c.pilfering_topk(k);
      }

    private:
      std::vector<Datum> data_;
    };

    Graph g1 = Graph(10, a);               // non-mutating
    Graph g2 = Graph(10, a, PilferTag());  // pilfer the top 10
    Graph g3 = Graph(10, c);               // non-mutating
    Graph g4 = Graph(10, c, PilferTag());  // error

## Approach 3: Tags all the way down?

We might look at our last snippet and claim that we have a "good technical reason" to use
the same name _all the way down our stack!_ We'd be wrong, but let's suppose we claim it
anyway. Then we might try for a solution like the following. Notice the simpler `Graph`
class. But we also run into exactly the problem from
["Name lookup in multiple base classes"](/blog/2024/04/17/name-lookup-in-base-classes/) (2024-04-17),
and have to solve it with `using`-declarations.

    struct Datum {};
    struct PilferTag { explicit PilferTag() = default; };

    struct PlainTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) const;      // non-mutating
    };

    struct PilferingTopkable {
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k, PilferTag); // pilfering
    };

    struct BothTopkable : PlainTopkable, PilferingTopkable {
      using PlainTopkable::topk;
      using PilferingTopkable::topk;
    };

    struct A : BothTopkable {};
    struct B : BothTopkable {};
    struct C : PlainTopkable {};
    struct D : PilferingTopkable {};

    struct Graph {
      template<class Fwd, class... Tags>
      explicit Graph(int k, Fwd&& c, Tags... tags) {
        data_ = c.topk(k, tags...);
      }

    private:
      std::vector<Datum> data_;
    };

    Graph g1 = Graph(10, a);               // non-mutating
    Graph g2 = Graph(10, a, PilferTag());  // pilfer the top 10
    Graph g3 = Graph(10, c);               // non-mutating
    Graph g4 = Graph(10, c, PilferTag());  // error

Here I'm using `Fwd&&` to bind to either `A&` or `const A&`, whatever the
caller happens to pass to me. Here `const Coll&` would be fine if I never wanted
to modify the collection; but in fact I _might_ want to modify it, depending on
what `Tags...` are. Arguably this is a lazy and unstylish use of a forwarding
reference.

## Approach 4: Preprocessor tricks

I don't recommend this approach personally, but it can be attractive in real codebases.
We could dispense with inheritance and the `using`-declarations that come with it,
and simply reimplement `topk` in each of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.
"But we wanted to write `topk` only once!" Sure — we'll just let the compiler cut-and-paste
our implementation into each class's body, using either a macro (as here) or an
`#include` directive.

    #define DEFINE_TOPK \
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k) const { ~~~ }

    #define DEFINE_TOPK_PILFERING \
      std::vector<Datum> topk(int k, PilferTag) { ~~~ }

    struct A {
      DEFINE_TOPK;
      DEFINE_TOPK_PILFERING;
    };
    struct B {
      DEFINE_TOPK;
      DEFINE_TOPK_PILFERING;
    };
    struct C {
      DEFINE_TOPK;
    };
    struct D {
      DEFINE_TOPK_PILFERING;
    };

    struct Graph {
      template<class Fwd, class... Tags>
      explicit Graph(int k, Fwd&& c, Tags... tags) {
        data_ = c.topk(k, tags...);
      }

    private:
      std::vector<Datum> data_;
    };

    Graph g1 = Graph(10, a);               // non-mutating
    Graph g2 = Graph(10, a, PilferTag());  // pilfer the top 10
    Graph g3 = Graph(10, c);               // non-mutating
    Graph g4 = Graph(10, c, PilferTag());  // error

My personal feeling is that preprocessor tricks are fine in moderation
(see [the #preprocessor category](/blog/tags/#preprocessor) on this blog),
but designing a single "thing" (`topk`) to rely on preprocessor macros
_and_ templates _and_ perfect-forwarding is asking too much of the reader.

Obviously I prefer Approach 2, that being the only one that never gives two things
the same name.
