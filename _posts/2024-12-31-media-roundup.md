In 2024, for the first time, I kept a record of the media that I took in
this year. Well, not "media" in the news-media sense (however relevant that
might have been), but in the sense of books, films, stage shows; and to
a lesser extent, journal articles, magazines, TV series, and long-form
online content.

## Methodology

Every time I finished a work, I wrote down the work's title, author,
year of composition (if available), and the date I finished it, along
with a one-letter annotation of its kind (`b` for book, `f` for film, etc.),
and two kinds of formalized tag: &#x2672; for things I had viewed before and
&#x2B50; for things I decided were good enough to... well, to merit a star, I guess.
Those criteria were certainly arbitrary and momentary. I felt a self-imposed pressure
to "calibrate": the pressure to award a star increasing with the time elapsed since
the previous star.

A star means "good" or "recommended"; I didn't bother to distinguish "bad, terrible, avoid"
from "decent, meh, whatever," but maybe I should have.

I tracked "ebooks" (under `e`) separately from "books" (under `b`).
Quickly I realized that the distinction was arbitrary and
meaningless; but as I look back over the list, I also realize that my `e`
entries are a more wildly mixed bag: `b` corresponds to my reading a real book
cover-to-cover, whereas I ended up using `e` indiscriminately for whole books
(Kafka's [_Parables and Paradoxes_](https://archive.org/details/parablesparadoxe0000kafk/))
and single short stories
(Doyle's [_The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton_](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Return_of_Sherlock_Holmes/Chapter_7)).
Of course, if I'd distinguished "short stories" differently from "novels,"
I'd have had trouble classifying novellas; and in fact I already had trouble
deciding whether to label certain works (Poe's ["Maelzel's Chess-Player"](https://books.google.com/books?id=pMwRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA346))
with `e` or with `j` for "journal article."

I didn't generally track "poems" as a category, which largely spared me from the
same thorny questions of length re: poetry. I confidently recorded Alexander Pope's
[_Essay on Criticism_](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/69379/an-essay-on-criticism) in June
(and gave it a star); but it felt silly to record Coleridge's [_Kubla Khan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan)
in December, and I certainly didn't record ["’Ware Wire"](/blog/2018/06/20/ware-wire/)
or "Dulce et Decorum Est" or ["Nix"](https://www.bethanyabelseth.com/carmina-tempestiva.html).

I also didn't record "music" as a category. I very, very rarely sit down and listen to music
as an activity in itself. (Exception this month: Buckner & Garcia's [_Pac-Man Fever_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_Fever_(album)) (1982).
["Ode to a Centipede"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnmTgEBRqI) alone would have earned a star;
but the album as a whole? well, I'm glad I didn't have to decide.) Of course I listen to lots of individual
songs in the car, but that'd be too many to track by hand anyway. At the same time, I did record
Gayden Wren's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nst3UzMPqUg">"A G&S Christmas Carol"</a>
(arbitrarily annotated as `f`-ilm), despite the YouTube recording's having no visual component.

Tracking the "date" of a work also proved arbitrary. Many works I read in translation.
Sometimes the translator's name and the date of translation were obvious; sometimes
only the original author and/or date of composition; sometimes only the date of publication
(Karl Werder tr. Elizabeth Wilder, _The Heart of Hamlet's Mystery_, 1907). Sometimes
the English text I was reading had no direct correspondence to any collation of texts
published in the author's lifespan
([_Parables and Paradoxes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parables_and_Paradoxes) again:
a collection of translations by many different authors, published in 1961).

I decided never to record a work I didn't finish. Very rarely, this pertained to
a work I had intended to view all the way through but which turned out actually insufferable
(Wallace Stevens' ["The Comedian as the Letter C"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47428/the-comedian-as-the-letter-c);
Marvel's [_Secret Invasion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Invasion_(miniseries));
I'm sure there were movie examples, but of course I failed to record them). More often,
this pertained to a "comfort viewing" (mine or my wife's) of something that would have
gotten the ♲ tag anyway, abandoned halfway due to interruption or sleep (mine or my wife's):
_The Fellowship of the Ring_, _Die Hard_, _Elf_. But my being on my phone or half-dozing for
the majority of a movie wouldn't disqualify it. I wasn't trying to record
_only_ the movies good enough to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout, but also the boring
bombs (_Castle of Fu Manchu_ (1969); the Berle/Caesar/Thomas vehicle _Side by Side_ (1988)).
The omission of unfinished viewings meant
that I watched many, many episodes of TV shows that I didn't record. Nor did I care to expend
the effort recording each individual TV episode; so I just recorded when finishing an entire season.
Of course _that_ didn't work for shows like Seth Meyers' [_Corrections_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s362-1ydl2g&list=PLJaq64dKJZopIwlqdjPra6a0sHoh_tlVZ)
(is it even a TV show?), which has no seasons per se. And it leaves unrecorded the sheer volume
of, say, _Seinfeld_ reruns watched out of order; not to mention all the shows we're in the middle of
(_Curb Your Enthusiasm_ S2, [_ALF_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)) S1,
_Only Murders in the Building_ S4, _Bob's Burgers_ S15).

Likewise, any books I started but didn't finish this year didn't make it into the list.
There's a continuum, too, between books I'm actively reading ([_Le Ton beau de Marot_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Ton_beau_de_Marot) (1997);
[_An Experiment with Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Experiment_with_Time) (1927);
Dante's [_Paradiso_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradiso_(Dante))),
books I started long ago and haven't yet come back to
([Baugh](https://archive.org/details/historyofenglis100albe/mode/2up)'s [_History of the English Language_](https://archive.org/details/historyofenglis100albe)),
and books I'll never pick up again.

Perhaps in 2025 I should record when I start a thing and when I finish it. Recording only the
end-date makes a graph artificially "spiky"; for example, on 2024-02-17 I finished both
William Yardley's [_Avellaneda's Continuation of Don Quixote_](https://archive.org/details/acontinuationhi01saavgoog/) (1784) and
Louis Sachar's [_Wayside School is Falling Down_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_School_Is_Falling_Down) (1989),
but both had been "in progress" for quite a while before that.

Also: I read _Wayside School is Falling Down_ aloud to my wife (who'd missed out on it as a kid),
and confidently recorded that as a re-read. But I also read her all of Dante's _Inferno_, trailing
my own reading by several months — by the time we finished _Inferno_, I was well into _Purgatorio_ —
and didn't bother to record that as a "second reading" of _Inferno_. On the third hand, I read
W.V. Quine's essay ["On What There Is"](https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil375/Quine.pdf) for
the first time in February, and then again a month and a half later, and recorded _that_ as a second
reading.

I recorded entries for short films ([_The Big Shave_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Shave) (1967),
[_Captain Kidd's Kids_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Kidd%27s_Kids) (1919), both via HBO Max);
and recorded films that I watched via YouTube as the content provider
([_L'Inferno_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRUkyHvsvfg) (1911),
[_The Great White Hope_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbA6MqD-ihI) (1970)); yet I didn't bother
to record YouTube videos that "weren't films," whether from
[Captain Disillusion](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainDisillusion) or
[CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/@CppCon).

## Book clubs

An aspect that I don't know how to work in without a lot of tedium (for both me-the-categorizer and you-the-reader)
is the existence of "constellations" of related works, some of whose connections are obvious and some of which aren't.
Two obvious small constellations (both involving long-form `o`-nline pieces that I bothered to record
only _because_ they were part of constellations):

<div class="smaller">

## Recommendations and breakdowns

I bothered to record my consumption of 9 `o`-nline pieces, 12 `s`-tage shows,
22 seasons of `t`-elevision, 27 `m`-agazines, 56 dead-tree `b`-ooks,
62 `j`-ournal articles, 119 `e`-books (of wildly variable length),
and 200 `f`-ilms, for a total of 507 items. (Wow!)

The films that in my arbitrary scheme merited a star were:

I thought it might be interesting to plot the works' years-of-creation (via [Python](/blog/code/2024-12-31-cumul.py)); but no, these cumulative histograms
are unsurprising. Except that somehow I went this whole year without watching any films from the WWII years —
no _Maltese Falcon_, no _Casablanca_, no _Citizen Kane_ or _Colonel Blimp_ or _Yankee Doodle Dandy_ or _Double Indemnity_
or _Key Largo_ or _Gilda_ — just a giant lacuna between 1939 (_Gone With the Wind_, _The Return of Dr. X_, _The Roaring Twenties_)
and 1947 (_The Two Mrs. Carrolls_). That does surprise me.

Here's year of creation plotted horizontally against date-of-viewing vertically (via [Python](/blog/code/2024-12-31-slalom.py)).
The blue star at 1872 represents Darwin's _Origin of Species_; the one at 2019 is Gretchen McCulloch's
[_Because Internet_](/blog/2024/06/19/what-if-was-for-puppies/). In the right-hand plot, you can very clearly see a transition
from films released in 2023 to those released in 2024; the starred 2024 film is _Conclave_, which I saw on the big screen,
and which I starred for the costumes and set design, the architecture of Rome, much more than for its plot. It might not translate.
On the other hand, _Hundreds of Beavers_ (2022) earned its star on the small screen.
