Charles Haddon Spurgeon, whom we met in [yesterday's post](/blog/2025/02/28/both-sides-of-the-shield/),
tells the following "Spartan saying" (Plutarch [234D](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html#T234d))
better than Plutarch does:

> I want you to be like the Spartan who painted on his shield a fly. "Your escutcheon is very small,"
> said one. "True," said he, "but I hold it very close to the enemy."
> ("#1531: On Whose Side are You?," [1880](https://www.spurgeon.org/resource-library/sermons/on-whose-side-are-you/))

Plutarch tells this one ([235B](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html#T235b)) all right:

> When Philip of Macedon sent some orders to the Spartans by letter, they wrote thus in reply: "As to what you wrote about: No."

There's a whole discourse on "what kind of monkey is Curious George" — Barbary macaque!
Chimpanzee! — but surprisingly little on what kind of monkey the Lego
["Brown Monkey with Yellow Hands and Feet"](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2550c01)
is supposed to be. Maybe a [golden-handed tamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-handed_tamarin)
(_Saguinus midas_), whose native range isn't far from the Caribbean.

On the [San Francisco Lamplighters' Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/lamplightersmt/)
this month: their 2017 Gala parody _Patterday Night Live._ It's no
_Rosencrantz & Guildenstern's Excellent Adventure_ (1995), but it has its moments.
I particularly enjoyed the repeated appearance — what I serendipitously just heard is
["called a _runner_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Kecgas24k&t=404s) — of
"Deep Notes with Jack Pointey." (Solemnly, to the tune of "Tit-Willow.")
