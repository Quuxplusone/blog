Charles Haddon Spurgeon, whom we met in [yesterday's post](/blog/2025/02/28/both-sides-of-the-shield/),
tells the following "Spartan saying" (Plutarch [234D](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html#T234d))
better than Plutarch does:

> I want you to be like the Spartan who painted on his shield a fly. "Your escutcheon is very small,"
> said one. "True," said he, "but I hold it very close to the enemy."
> ("#1531: On Whose Side are You?," [1880](https://www.spurgeon.org/resource-library/sermons/on-whose-side-are-you/))

Plutarch tells this one ([235B](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html#T235b)) all right:

> When Philip of Macedon sent some orders to the Spartans by letter, they wrote thus in reply: "As to what you wrote about: No."

There's a whole discourse on "what kind of monkey is Curious George" — Barbary macaque!
Chimpanzee! — but surprisingly little on what kind of monkey the Lego
["Brown Monkey with Yellow Hands and Feet"](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2550c01)
is supposed to be. Maybe a [golden-handed tamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-handed_tamarin)
(_Saguinus midas_), whose native range isn't far from the Caribbean.

On the [San Francisco Lamplighters' Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/lamplightersmt/)
this month: their 2017 Gala parody _Patterday Night Live._ It's no
_Rosencrantz & Guildenstern's Excellent Adventure_ (1995), but it has its moments.
I particularly enjoyed the repeated appearance — what I serendipitously just heard is
["called a _runner_"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-Kecgas24k&t=404s) — of
"Deep Notes with Jack Pointey." (Solemnly, to the tune of "Tit-Willow.")

Dryden, [_Dramatic Poetry of the Last Age_](https://books.google.com/books?id=-0HOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA224) (1672):

> Shakespeare shewed the best of his skill in his Mercutio; and he said himself, that he was forced to
> kill him in the third act, to prevent being killed by him. But, for my part, I cannot find he was so
> dangerous a person; I see nothing in him but what was so exceeding harmless, that he might have lived
> to the end of the play, and died in his bed, without offence to any man.

Donald Knuth once conjectured that any integer can be expressed by starting with a single "4" and
repeatedly applying the factorial, square root, and floor functions.
(["Representing Numbers Using Only One 4"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2689238), _Mathematics Magazine_ 37(5), Nov–Dec 1964.)
His article is reprinted in [_Selected Papers on Fun & Games_](https://amzn.to/3QGlT79) (2011), where Knuth adds an addendum ending:

> With the ceiling function we can of course do better. The best representation that I currently know for "64 with one 4,"
> eschewing exotic unary operations such as !! and ¡, is
>
> 64 = ⌈√√√√√⌈√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√√⌊√√⌊√⌈√√√√√(4!)!⌉!⌋!⌋!⌉!⌉.

I learned that !! stands for the ["double factorial"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_factorial) function, [OEIS A006882](https://oeis.org/A006882);
and ¡ stands for the "subfactorial," [OEIS A000166](https://oeis.org/A000166).
In [this MathOverflow post](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/228364/pronunciation-of-inverted-exclamation-mark-historically-used-for-subfactoria)
from 2016, Fred Daniel Kline wisely suggests that in a computing context,
if `!` is pronounced "bang," then `¡` should be pronounced "GNAB" — a recursive acronym
for "GNAB's Not A Bang."

In INTERCAL (the Computer Language with No Pronounceable Acronym) `!` is pronounced "wow."
In Spanish, ¡ is merely the "signo inicial de admiración"; when
[the Royal Academy invented it from whole cloth](https://books.google.com/books?id=KjNlEhhjR60C&pg=PA126) in 1754,
they just called it the "nota de admiración [puesta] inversa." If it has a slang nickname
in Spanish, I haven't heard.
