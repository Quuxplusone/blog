I offer corporate training in the modern C++ programming language.
<a href="mailto:arthur.j.odwyer@gmail.com">Email me today</a> to get started!

### Why train my team?

- <b>Orienting new hires.</b> Communal team training gets everyone on the same page.
    You won't discover six months in that two of your new hires don't know what
    smart pointers are, or how `string` differs from `string_view`, or how
    comparison operators work in C++20.

- <b>Upgrading your codebase.</b> The C++ standard expands every three years.
    While compiler support does trail the paper standard, it's generally expected
    that your codebase will move from C++17 to C++20 to C++23. A trainer's expertise
    helps you make feature decisions — where and how do we use `auto`? Ranges? Modules? —
    and avoid pitfalls.

- <b>Crash courses.</b> Your team knows C++17 inside and out. But you've decided
    your next codebase will go all in on C++20 Concepts and Ranges.
    Focused, trustworthy training with an expert can do in days what would take
    weeks given only StackOverflow and ChatGPT.

### Format

My typical training is arranged as a 16-hour or 20-hour (four- or five-half-day) course
which alternates PowerPoint lectures with hands-on C++ coding exercises. Each lab exercise
requires writing and compiling actual C++ code, and reinforces the material learned in the
preceding lecture.

This can be done on-site, or online (e.g. via Zoom or Teams); in fact online is easier.
If you're looking for on-site training, be aware that I'm geographically located in the New York City area.

Permission to record the training, and keep the recording for up to (3–6–12) months, can be granted.

### Quotes from satisfied clients

> Arthur has been our first instructor that is intimately familiar with both the core language and standard library.
> His passion for C++ makes it easy for me to stay focused on the material being presented.

> His presentation of the slides was at the right level of abstraction for me.
> The labs were well thought out and at the right level of complexity.

> Arthur was well prepared and knowledgeable, but approachable.
> He presents, communicates, and interacts well.
> It was really a great experience.

### Sample course outlines

<b>Fundamentals of C++</b> — This "package course" is suitable for anyone experienced
in an imperative programming language such as Python or JavaScript, as well as anyone
who wants a coherent overview of C++ from the ground up. The eight labs build on each
other, starting with a simple string reversal using `char*` and culminating in a
classically polymorphic class hierarchy managed with smart pointers.

- Parameter-passing, pointers and references, `const`
- Separate compilation, namespaces, `inline`
- Arrays, `sizeof`, function overloading
- Function templates, iterators, `vector`
- Lambdas, erase-remove idiom
- `new`/`delete`, special members, RAII, exceptions
- `unique_ptr` and `make_unique`
- Move semantics
- More STL containers: `multiset`, comparators, `pair`
- Inheritance, polymorphism, virtual dispatch, `dynamic_cast`

<b>Intermediate C++</b> — Collaborate to tailor a custom intermediate-level course
from topic-based units, each approximately two hours in length. Units appropriate
for an intermediate course include:

- New-in-C++11 must-haves such as `auto`, `nullptr`, and `static_assert`
- `decltype` and `<type_traits>`
- Templates, explicit specialization, and partial specialization
- Deep dive on lambdas
- `enum` and `union`
- Deep dive on smart pointers (`unique_ptr` and `shared_ptr`)
- Deep dive on the STL iterator model
- Deep dive on the STL container zoo and iterator invalidation
- Unordered associative containers and `hash`
- Move semantics and rvalue references
- Forwarding references, perfect forwarding, and variadic templates
- `string_view`
- Name lookup, ADL, and the hidden friend idiom
- C++20 `requires`-clauses and concepts

<b>Advanced C++</b> — Units appropriate for an advanced-level course include:

- Deep dive on `optional`, `variant`, `tuple`, and `expected`
- Type erasure: `function` and `any`
- Using "triviality" for optimization
- Interfacing with C
- Deep dive on macros and the C preprocessor
- Metaprogramming with `if constexpr`, tag dispatch, and SFINAE
- Compile-time programming with `constexpr` and `consteval`
- C++20 comparisons and `operator<=>`
- C++20 `std::format`
- Introduction to C++20 Ranges
- The `std::views` zoo
- C++23 explicit object parameter syntax and "deducing `this`"
